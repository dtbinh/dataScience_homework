    <AbstractNarration>This multifaceted project, with core partners including Virginia community colleges, the Virginia Space Grant Consortium, and the Virginia Geospatial Extension Program, is supporting the preparation of a regional workforce skilled in geospatial technologies (GST), which enhance the collection, analysis, and interpretation of spatial data. Activities include 1) collaborative development of GST courses, pathways and curricula aligned with the Department of Labor's Geospatial Technology Competency Model, 2) GST program enhancement through intensive faculty professional development and mentoring, 3) creation of courses in advanced GST available to community college students throughout the state, and 4) development of mobile GST applications for education. Partnering community colleges are implementing strategies to increase student enrollment and diversity in GST programs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a growing demand for spatial analysis applications and solutions, fueled by the increasing availability of spatial data and software tools for their analysis. GST is a rapidly expanding industry that cuts across nearly every discipline and sector of the U.S. economy. The project is directly addressing these advanced technological workforce needs in the Virginia region. Moreover, the updated and innovative GST courses, pathways, and professional development are advancing the field and serving as models for others. Project materials and resources are being shared statewide and nationally through Virginia Community College System and the GeoTech Center web portals.</AbstractNarration>
