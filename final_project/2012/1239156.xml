    <AbstractNarration>Tuan Vo-Dinh&lt;br/&gt;1239156&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the organization of the conference EUROPT(R)ODE XI, which is part of&lt;br/&gt;the Europt(r)ode Conference series, which encompasses all aspects related to the research,&lt;br/&gt;development and applications of optical chemical sensors and biosensors.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The EUROPT(R)ODE XI Conference, to be held in Barcelona, Spain, April 1-4, 2012, will&lt;br/&gt;discuss the latest advances in this competitive and evolving field of optical sensors. The&lt;br/&gt;Conference is the premier worldwide forum for the presentation of innovations in optical&lt;br/&gt;sensing, showing both cutting-edge integration concepts and key emerging trends in a highly&lt;br/&gt;multi-disciplinary atmosphere. This biannual Conference presents an exceptional opportunity,&lt;br/&gt;of interest to both academic and industrial researchers, to discuss and exchange the latest&lt;br/&gt;developments in this extremely challenging field. There is no other Conference specifically&lt;br/&gt;devoted to optical (bio)sensing, thus making this meeting unique at the international level.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The Europt(r)ode conference series has become a major scientific meeting on optical chemical&lt;br/&gt;sensors and biosensors attracting scientists and educators from across the globe. Because of the&lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary nature of the field, Europt(r)ode has always brought together a diverse&lt;br/&gt;audience including scientists and engineers in physics, chemistry and biology all over the world.&lt;br/&gt;Their engaging discussions have stimulated interdisciplinary and international collaborations&lt;br/&gt;and helped shape scientific and academic institutions from which several generations of PhD&lt;br/&gt;students have graduated. The Conference has also fostered increasing collaborations between&lt;br/&gt;academia and industry and stimulated countless new commercial spin-offs in the field.&lt;br/&gt;Companies participate regularly not only at the level of exhibitors but though invited and oral or&lt;br/&gt;poster presentations. The Conference in 2012 will have, as a main novelty, an exclusive&lt;br/&gt;Industrial Session by invitation, where the main industrial players in the field will highlight&lt;br/&gt;scientific innovations and technological transfer in the optical sensing field.</AbstractNarration>
