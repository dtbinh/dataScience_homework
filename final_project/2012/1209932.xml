    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Chelsea Anne Griffith of Western Michigan University to conduct a research project, entitled "Practical analysis of seismic responses of structures," during the summer of 2012 at the National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering at National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan. The host scientist is Dr. Keh-Chyuan Tsai. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the contribution to the stability and accuracy of large scale hybrid testing in earthquake engineering. The research demonstrates that hybrid testing is an economical alternative to traditional testing methods as it combines experimental and analytical models to characterize overall structural response. A full scale critical assembly can be tested while remainder of the structure is modeled by computer, thus eliminating the need for an entirely physical prototype specimen. Results of hybrid tests are applied to safer, more efficient design and evaluation of new and existing structures, respectively. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
