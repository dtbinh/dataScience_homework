    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Xuan Luong of University of California, Berkeley to conduct a research project, entitled "Determining the basis of differential estrogen sensitivity in African clawed frog larvae (Xenipus laevis)," during the summer of 2012 at Kitasato University in Sagamihara, Minami-ku, Kitasato. The host scientist is Dr. Michihiko Ito.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to determine if variances in gene expression are the bases of differential estrogen sensitivity observed at the population and individual levels of Xenopus laevis, and if so, identify the responsible gene(s). The goal is to better understand the mechanisms of sex differentiation using an amphibian model, the African clawed frog. an important aspect to address is the role of estrogen (E2) in this process at the population and individual levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
