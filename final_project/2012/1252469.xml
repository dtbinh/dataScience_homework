    <AbstractNarration>The Annual Meeting of the Association for Education Communications and Technology (AECT) provides a forum for interchange of ideas around designing technological support for learning and training. Its Early Career Symposia provide an avenue for early career scholars to receive mentoring from established researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2012 Annual Meeting has the theme, "Learning in an Age of Globalization," and mentors for the Early Career Symposium are among the leaders in this area and, more generally, instructional and educational technology. This project supports travel for advanced graduate students and new faculty from U.S. universities to attend the Annual Meeting and Early Career Symposium. Sessions during the Symposium are designed to help collaborators imagine forward-looking and viable technology-oriented research agendas, identify the types of collaborators who complement their strengths, and identify the funding agencies and programs that might support their work. An important goal of the Symposium is to add to the community of researchers interested in ways that technology can transform teaching and learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity supports the mission of NSF to train more advanced professionals in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. This conference is one among many that researchers in the cyberlearning community regularly attend. Mentors come from the AECT community as well as from the learning sciences community.</AbstractNarration>
