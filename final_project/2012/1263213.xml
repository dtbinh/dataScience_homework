    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) summer program at Virginia Tech is focused on space science and engineering research. NSF funding supports a three-year program that begins with support for 6 REU student participants during the first year, 8 during the second year, and 10 during the third year as we gain experience and build up the program. Our goal is to provide upper division undergraduate REU students with an engaging, high-quality learning and interdisciplinary research experience in space weather science and engineering, a discipline of increasing importance to our technology based society. At least half of the participants each summer will be underrepresented students and at least half will be from institutions with limited research programs. Students will select research projects and will work individually or in small teams guided and mentored by faculty and senior graduate students or post-doctoral scholars. Through this REU program, the participants will: (1) acquire intellectual creativity and independence; (2) reason and think critically about the knowledge domain using Socratic cognitive strategies; (3) clearly articulate research problems, methods and results to diverse audiences (scientists, engineers, and communities); (4) contribute significantly and actively to real-world space research using high-quality methodological and analytical approaches; (5) understand space weather phenomena and their potential impacts on technology, as well as their beauty and mystery; and (6) develop skills to be space science messengers to enhance the accessibility and meaningfulness of space science to the general public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of our scientific understanding of the space environment is an important national enterprise and the space science and engineering research at Virginia Tech contribute to the understanding of the complex interactions of solar radiation with the Earth's environment. This is accomplished through research programs that utilize ground-based measurements of space phenomena, in-situ satellite-based measurements and the development of new technology for small satellite payloads, as well as theoretical investigations and computer simulations of space plasmas. The expected impact of this program is to attract talented undergraduate students to graduate study in STEM areas thereby developing a scientific and technical workforce that can contribute to industry, academic and government needs.</AbstractNarration>
