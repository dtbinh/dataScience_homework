    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop a state-of-the-art photonic chip-scale probing solution for integrated Si-photonics testing and to enable new multidisciplinary collaborative projects in nano-photonics and opto-electronics. The approach exploits a universal electronic-photonic probing station that integrates electrical, optical far-field, and optical near-field probes for electrical and optical interfacing to integrated circuits and to individual elements within such circuits, together with a full set of external optical and electronic instrumentation to provide an affordable, zero-capital-investment testing capability for Research and Development by academic, industry and government laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this versatile and user friendly Si-Photonics testing instrument includes basic research to identify new phenomena, inventing new photonic technology and creating new applications, as well as providing tremendous benefit to small businesses, various research institutions and government laboratories in their product development efforts. Moreover, it can serve as a testbed for development and reduction to practice of new approaches for efficiently probing and testing Si-photonic chips, gradually evolving to become industry standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the instrument spans multiple fields, including information systems, high speed electronics and photonics, and future computer science and engineering to create wealth for 21st century economy by advancing integration of nanoscale photonic, electronic and biomedical science and technology. It will provide service to industry in Southern California and play a significant role in the education and development of human resources in science and engineering at the graduate and undergraduate levels helping to train future engineers.</AbstractNarration>
