    <AbstractNarration>The project will develop a general framework for defining risk measures for systems consisting of&lt;br/&gt;a set of interacting agents with uncertain joint outcomes. This framework will define convex&lt;br/&gt;programming-based axioms that characterize a very general class of systemic measures. This class&lt;br/&gt;of risk measures includes all the ad hoc risk measures that have been recently proposed in the&lt;br/&gt;literature. The optimization-based approach leads to a primal-dual representation for the systemic&lt;br/&gt;risk that allows attribution of the overall risk to individual agents in a fair manner, as well as&lt;br/&gt;the development of decentralized algorithms for systemic risk sensitive social welfare&lt;br/&gt;maximization. The project will seek to extend this representation to include a larger class of&lt;br/&gt;risk functions. New structural models will aid the study of the role of contagion in complex&lt;br/&gt;systems. A statistical methodology will be developed for identifying systemically important&lt;br/&gt;factors and the exposure of the system to these factors. These systemic factors would lead to&lt;br/&gt;methods for robust and efficient estimation of systemic risk. Systemic risk measure based&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for the design and control of the network structure underlying complex systems will&lt;br/&gt;also be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent events across many disparate settings (e.g., the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in&lt;br/&gt;2010, the financial crisis in 2008, the Northeastern blackout in 2003) have all highlighted the&lt;br/&gt;critical importance of risk management in general, and systemic risk management in&lt;br/&gt;particular. Progress on tools for systemic risk management will help prevent, or at least better&lt;br/&gt;manage, future systemic failures in financial, public health, environmental, national security,&lt;br/&gt;and governmental domains. The proposed research is synergistic with ongoing relationships and&lt;br/&gt;collaborations the PIs maintain with industry and policy-making groups concerned with systemic&lt;br/&gt;risk in electricity grids and in capital markets. In addition, the project will provide funding&lt;br/&gt;for research and educational opportunities for students.</AbstractNarration>
