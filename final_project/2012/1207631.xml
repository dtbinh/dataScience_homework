    <AbstractNarration>Although the advent of adaptive optics (AO) has ushered in an era of dramatic discoveries that make use of the superb resolution of large ground-based telescopes, lack of knowledge of the point spread function (PSF) still stands as a fundamental limitation. Extragalactic, galactic and solar system AO science programs currently rely on non-synchronous PSF calibration stars, which results in increased random and systematic errors in astrometry, photometry, morphology and kinematics. The future of quantitative AO science, and the goal of the project proposed by Dr. Peter Wizinowich and his collaborators at the California Association for Research in Astronomy, lies in reconstructing synchronous PSF knowledge based on real-time telemetry collected from the telescope and AO system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will develop PSF determination tools for on-axis both natural and laser guide-star AO science observations and demonstrate the quantitative science improvements that can be realized with these tools using the 10-m diameter Keck telescopes. The significantly improved capabilities produced through this program will be directly available to astronomers at the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the University of Hawaii through their time allocation committees, while the entire U.S. community will benefit due to their access to Keck through NASA and the NSF Telescope System Instrumentation Program. Moreover, success at the Keck Observatory would enable PSF determination to become a reality for AO on large telescopes worldwide, as the algorithms and techniques will be made publically available. Keck will also reinforce its role in the training of AO experts and continue to offer educational programs and services to work with local residents, educators and especially students, including its strong participation in the Akamai Workforce Initiative aimed at local Hawaiian students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for the development of real-time PSF assessment techniques is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>
