    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Sean C. Reber of Kent State University to conduct a research project, entitled "Computational feature-based texture synthesis on flow fields," during the summer of 2012 at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Integration Technology in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China. The host scientist is George Chen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is producing realistic fluid representation and animation in movies, games and other digital media and assisting in visualizing and analyzing flow data or vector fields for scientific applications. The goal of the research is to improve upon the existing methods of Lagrangian based texture advection, using a Poisson-disk distribution of particles, and optimization based texture synthesis by adapting them with structural features extracted from flow fields using finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
