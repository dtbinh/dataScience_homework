    <AbstractNarration>With the ever increasing popularity of smartphone and mobile devices, the past few years have witnessed a tremendous growth of wireless video/audio applications, including VoIP, video streaming, real-time surveillance. Meeting the deadline of such real-time wireless traffic is particularly challenging since wireless transmissions are often unreliable. Serving real-time traffic is also a key component of many cyber-physical systems (CPS) - the smart grid is one archetypal example of such CPS systems. Under one common theme of meeting the deadlines of real-time traffic, this project is centered around two emerging applications, namely wireless multimedia applications and smart electric vehicles (EV) charging. Since the optimal solution to such deadline scheduling problems requires to explicitly take into account the coupling in the deadlines and the stochastic characteristics of the traffic, this project is focused on developing low-complexity MDP-based scheduling algorithms for real-time wireless scheduling and smart charging, and is organized in three well-coordinated thrusts: 1) joint scheduling and adaptive network coding for real-time traffic over memoryless channels; 2) downlink scheduling for real-time traffic flows over Markovian channels; and 3) risk-aware deadline scheduling for smart EV charging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will significantly advance the state-of-the-art of deadline scheduling for wireless multimedia applications and EV charging, and open up new interdisciplinary research directions. The research findings will significantly enhance wireless multimedia transmissions and contribute to the electrification of transportation. The broader impacts also include educational elements, such as promoting diversity by providing research opportunities to woman and underrepresented students.</AbstractNarration>
