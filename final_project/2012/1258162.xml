    <AbstractNarration>Fungi are remarkable for the ecological niches they occupy and the ecological services they provide in both human-made and natural ecosystems. This project will investigate the genomic evolution of a large order of fungi, Hypocreales, which is diverse in both number of species and ecological functions. This research will involve sequencing of genomes and comparative analyses that focus on genome scale changes that promote shifts in ecologies (e.g., decomposers vs. pathogens) and nutritional modes (e.g., plant vs. animal-based carbon sources). The project is interdisciplinary and collaborative, employing tools from biological and computational sciences and researchers from three continents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fungi are promising sources of pharmaceuticals, alternatives for control of insect pests and bioremediation of contaminated soils, and essential in the development of biofuels. In order to exploit fungi for the betterment of society, however, a more robust understanding of patterns and processes that have led to the diversification of their genomes and subsequently their metabolism is necessary. To achieve these advancements, more students and young researchers trained in an interdisciplinary manner are needed, with the result being a qualified generation of scientists in academia, industry and government agencies equipped to study biological solutions to the challenges of the modern World.</AbstractNarration>
