    <AbstractNarration>The proposed activity entails adaptation of plasmonic interfaces with tunable optical properties to benefit a number of innovative applications relevant to renewable energy harvesting. These interfaces are fabricated by imparting a desired optical property to a surface from a bulk nanoparticulate suspension, referred to as nanopaint. The scientific foundation of the nanopaint technology is built upon a synergistic integration of the principles of thermodynamic self-assembly, physico-chemical interactions between nanoparticles and surfaces as well as a fundamental understanding of the optical properties of metal nanoparticles and their dependence on size, shape and composition. In addition, robust nanomanufacturing routes that allow for low cost and high volume production of the nanopaint-based interfaces are developed by utilizing process engineering principles. The translation of the nanopaint technology to the renewable energy arena requires that the abovementioned fundamental science and engineering platform be evaluated in the light of market variables and process economics. This will be the principal focus of the proposed I-Corps project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key innovation presented in this proposal is the ability to enable low cost, high volume manufacturing of hard or flexible multicomponent plasmonic interfaces capable of highly selective or broadband light harvesting. Current manufacturing bottlenecks associated with the incorporation of multiple species of particles onto an interface and poor stability characteristics of nano-suspensions are easily overcome by the nanopaint technology. Three major applications proposed are (i) smart glass envelopes for buildings, (ii) enhancing the light trapping and conversion efficiency of thin film photovoltaics (PVs), and (iii) increasing phototrophic growth rate of algal biomass. The transformative societal and commercial impacts of this platform technology include the following: &lt;br/&gt;(i) The ability to harvest and convert sunlight into heat through smart windows for residential and commercial buildings will reduce their carbon footprint. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) Integrating PVs with plasmonic interfaces will have significant benefits in terms of their overall energy efficiency and cost. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(iii) Practical and environmentally safe methods of plasmon-enhanced biomass growth will benefit biosensor technology as well as large scale production of algal biomass as feedstock for fuels and chemicals.</AbstractNarration>
