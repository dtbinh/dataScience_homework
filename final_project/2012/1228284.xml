    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The 19th Annual Southeastern Regional Yeast Meeting (SERYM) will be held on the campus of Emory&lt;br/&gt;University from February 24-26, 2012. This annual meeting provides a unique opportunity for yeast researchers from states in the Southeastern region of the U.S. to come together to share their preliminary research findings and discuss new research tools and emerging technologies. The proposed meeting on Yeast is unique in that it is a regional meeting designed to increase the participation of undergraduates, graduate students and underrepresented groups and because it is aimed at researchers investigating a variety of yeast species not limited to the more common model organisims S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. A key strength of this meeting is the opportunity for both undergraduate and graduate students to present their research in platform and/or poster formats. The regional nature of this meeting provides opportunities for students to discuss their research work with leading scientists, laying the foundation for future scientific development and collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;One of the goals of the meeting is to promote student attendance and participation and the requested funding will support the attendance of 16 students. Students had a strong presence at the 2011 meeting, with undergraduate and graduate students comprising 62% of the total meeting attendees and giving 62% of the platform and 66% of the poster presentations. Students from underrepresented groups will be given priority participation support. To increase the participation of students from underrepresented groups, we have invited students and mentors from Spelman College, Morehouse College, and Clayton State University to participate in SERYM 2012.</AbstractNarration>
