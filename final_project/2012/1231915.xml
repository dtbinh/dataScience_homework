    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to understand the effects of mechanical stresses and perturbations on the electronic properties of single molecule systems. By exploring the impacts of contact geometry, molecule-electrode coupling strength, tensile and compressive forces, and electron-phonon interactions on the charge transport properties of these devices this project will provide new information about how the detailed, atomic-level configuration of molecular systems affects the electronic properties.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is that developing a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between the mechanical and electrical properties of single-molecule systems will provide important information about controlling charge transport in these systems and enable transformative progress in the development of functional molecular-electronic systems. This includes the exploration of new functional paradigms for electromechanical computational schemes and transducers that can convert mechanical stimuli into electrical signals for use in sensor systems.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are that knowledge about the interaction between mechanical structure and charge transport will affect a variety of fields beyond molecular-scale electronics. This includes biology and chemistry where these interactions are extremely important for understanding protein systems like photosynthetic reactions centers. This research will also impact the study of both bulk organic and nanoscale electronics since controlling charge transport mechanically may allow for novel sensors, devices, and applications. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary research and educational program in this program will be three tiered with efforts focused on exposing K-12 students to engineering disciplines, undergraduate research opportunities, and graduate training and education.</AbstractNarration>
