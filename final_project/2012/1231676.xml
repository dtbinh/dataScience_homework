    <AbstractNarration>This project develops a portable power-assist orthosis to address the problems of impaired mobility due to lower-extremity weakness. This robotic orthosis actively assists the user's joint motion according to his or her motion intent, and thus enables the user to perform certain critical, power-consuming tasks (such as the sit-to-stand motion) independently. The orthosis is powered with a high-performance actuation approach, namely chemo-fluidic actuation, which combines the high-power-density pneumatic actuators with a high-energy-density monopropellant-based pneumatic supply. In addition to the new actuation approach, the orthosis also features a new structure and user interface for effective load transfer and easy donning-doffing; and an effective motion control algorithm to enable interactive power assist according to the user's motion intent. With the portable power-assist orthosis, the users reduce the reliance on the assistance by caregivers, enjoy a significantly improved life quality, and stay physically active to avoid the aforementioned issues associated with the sedentary life style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has broader impact to assistive technologies and can improve mobility of elderly individuals and people suffering from the impaired mobility due to lower-extremity weakness. The project can potentially reduce a considerable amount of physical assistance taking care of these individuals, and the cost of time and manpower in the care. The research of the project is incorporated into education activities by utilizing the rehabilitation robotics as an innovative education medium.</AbstractNarration>
