    <AbstractNarration>This action funds David Moscato of East Tennessee State University to conduct a research project, entitled "Ice Age lizards and snakes from Homo Sapiens Cave, China," during the summer of 2012 at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) in Beijing, China. The host scientists are Dr. Changzhu Jin and Dr. Yuan Wang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to advance understanding of the evolution and ecology of reptiles during a time of dramatic climate change, as well as during the earliest human inhabitation of China. Fossil reptiles provide clues to a better understanding of how these animals responded in the past to the dangers of climate change and the appearance of humans in their ecosystem. The results of this study promise to give a much greater ability to predict how these animals will respond in the future during climate change and as humans continue to encroach upon natural habitats. Lizards and snakes are some of the most diverse animals in the world today, yet are among the least understood in terms of conservation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
