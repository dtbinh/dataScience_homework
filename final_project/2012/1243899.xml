    <AbstractNarration>The High Frame Rate Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy system promises new fluorescence imaging capabilities at costs dramatically lower than current systems. By integrating detectors and converters on a single platform, frame rates in excess of 100 frames/second at a production cost of under $1000 should be possible. This compares with image acquisition times of a few seconds per frame at near 100 times the cost fopr currently-available systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will assist the team in assessing the commercial viability of the research that was previously sponsored by NSF. If successfully commercialized, the team will deliver a new technology that advances the state of the art in fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. This advancement will allow measurements of dynamics of fluorescence lifetimes with an inexpensive and simple system. These measurements could lead to further advances in microscopy as well as the development of new medical diagnostic systems. In addition to the scientific advances that would be possible with widespread adoption of the system, there would also be positive economic impacts that would result from transitioning the hardware from the lab and ramping production.</AbstractNarration>
