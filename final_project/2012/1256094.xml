    <AbstractNarration>1256094&lt;br/&gt;Sengupta&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop research and education collaborations between the US and India on water/wastewater treatment and water reuse, specifically in the context of decentralized, non-point sources through a workshop to be held at the campus of Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru from January 7-11, 2013. It will identify and analyze decentralized engineered systems that are passive, do not need trained personnel for operation, need minimal maintenance, are ideally suited for treating non-point sources, and can be easily installed in installation in rural areas. Special emphasis will be given to addressing technical, regulatory, and economic challenges faced in implementing water reuse projects and in ensuring that these projects have the active support of the local population that they serve. Through pilot-scale demonstration projects, several technologies will be evaluated for some contaminants of concern to both the US and India (arsenic, fluoride, and nitrate in groundwater, and emerging contaminants such as drugs, antibiotics, hormones and steroids in surface drinking water supplies). This project will also develop protocols for real-time monitoring of important surface water sources in the US and India for common pollutants. Technologies for removal and recovery of macronutrients (Nitrogen &amp; Phosphorus) from point sources and non-point sources will also be evaluated. The focus will be on developing protocols for implementation and evaluation of technologies developed by some of the workshop attendees. This project will also develop course curricula as a result of mutual knowledge exchange between Indian and U.S. researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will strengthen a strategic collaborative partnership between NSF and DST, Government of India. This workshop will provide American and Indian experts in the area of water quality and sustainability an opportunity to evaluate the water quality challenges facing both countries and exchange ideas and propose sustainable and cost-efficient solutions which can be implemented not only in the US and India but in other parts of the world facing similar challenges. Water sustainability and reuse is a global environmental challenge. While progress has been made in innovative treatment technologies that can accomplish removal of target pollutants, there is a strong need to evaluate a holistic system that includes applicability, scalability, cost, life cycle assessment, environmental impact, and ease of use. Moreover, water quality engineers in the US and India agree that more focus is needed toward decentralized, passive systems that treat non-point sources. This workshop will provide a framework that will cover the entire spectrum of adoption of a sustainable, innovative, and decentralized technology, from selection to obtaining regulatory approval to evaluation of the technology. The US contingency includes two graduate students and junior and senior faculty.</AbstractNarration>
