    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit. Mineral resources have always been an essential foundation of human civilization.&lt;br/&gt;Despite uncertain economic times for much of the world, prices for critical minerals continue to&lt;br/&gt;remain high as they are depleted by mining and as discovery of new resources becomes&lt;br/&gt;increasingly difficult. Even with greater recycling and substitution, increasing demand requires&lt;br/&gt;that metals and other rare elements will continue to be mined from ore deposits. Such deposits&lt;br/&gt;can only be utilized in an environmentally responsible manner if the ore elements are highly&lt;br/&gt;enriched by natural chemical and physical processes. These processes operate over a great range&lt;br/&gt;of spatial and temporal scales from the Earth?s interior to its surface, and from the earliest&lt;br/&gt;geological records of the planet to the present day. The 2012 Gordon Research Conference&lt;br/&gt;(GRC) on the Geochemistry of Mineral Deposits presents a forum to present and discuss new&lt;br/&gt;data and ideas on processes that control the formation and location of a wide range of mineral&lt;br/&gt;deposits, including precious metals, base metals, and other critical elements. Sessions will&lt;br/&gt;include lithospheric controls on mineral deposits, magmatic and hydrothermal processes that&lt;br/&gt;partition metals among various mineral and fluid phases, active hydrothermal systems as&lt;br/&gt;analogues to mineral deposits, and dynamic processes involved in ore genesis, including&lt;br/&gt;variations the fluxes and chemistry of magma and volatiles, tectonic triggers to regional ore&lt;br/&gt;formation, and the physical hydrogeology of hydrothermal systems. Evening sessions will focus&lt;br/&gt;on puzzling, controversial and commonly overlooked ore systems. These systems include the&lt;br/&gt;African Copper Belt in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, iron oxide-copper-gold&lt;br/&gt;systems, and systems that form rare earth elements, which have critical high-technology and&lt;br/&gt;environmental applications. Another evening session focuses on the distal expressions of large&lt;br/&gt;ore systems, which is of interest to private industry and government agencies involved in&lt;br/&gt;exploration and mineral assessments, which are important to land use decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. GRCs provide a unique opportunity for scientists from government, academia and&lt;br/&gt;industry from all over the world to meet in an informal setting. GRCs provide a level of intimacy&lt;br/&gt;not experienced in other conferences. Attendance is limited to 160 participants, emphasis is on&lt;br/&gt;discussion, and there are no concurrent sessions. Few conferences bring together such a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of scientists of both experience and focus, which ranges from pure, process-related&lt;br/&gt;research to applied research. Not all the participants specialize in ore deposits. Researchers&lt;br/&gt;focused on igneous petrology, aqueous and isotope geochemistry, fluid flow, and active&lt;br/&gt;hydrothermal systems are speaking and leading sessions. With such an intimate setting, the&lt;br/&gt;participants have little choice but to interact with each other during the conference. Such&lt;br/&gt;interactions commonly lead to unforeseen collaborations. Funds will be provided to students,&lt;br/&gt;post-docs, and other young investigators to assist them in attending in the meeting, thus affording&lt;br/&gt;them the opportunity to network with recognized experts in both academia and industry and have&lt;br/&gt;a say in the future directions of mineral deposit research.</AbstractNarration>
