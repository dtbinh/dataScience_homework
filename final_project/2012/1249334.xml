    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technological development is paced by the creation and putting into service of materials that are ever-more capable of withstanding extreme conditions, such as high stress, temperature, radiation and long-term service. This Gordon Research Conference on Physical Metallurgy provides a forum for the presentation of cutting-edge experimental and modeling research on materials at extremes, such materials with ultra-high strengths relative to their ideal strengths and materials that can operate at high temperatures relative to their melting points. Understanding the effects of extremes in the physical size-scale and microstructure is critical to advancing the performance of materials under demanding conditions. Presentations will describe developments in state-of-the-art experimental techniques for evaluating material behavior and microstructure, and complementary computational and modeling efforts aimed at fundamental understanding of materials under these extreme conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technological development is paced by the creation and putting into service of materials that are ever-more capable of withstanding extreme conditions, such as high stress, temperature, radiation and long-term service.
