    <AbstractNarration>The Targeted Infusion Project entitled - Developing a Social Computing Program at North Carolina A&amp;T State University - has the goal to establish a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) concentration in Social Computing. Graduates with training in social computing are prepared to inform empirical research, professional practice, and public and social policy as it pertains to both information technology and social change in a globalized society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a joint effort of the Departments of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Sociology and will strengthen partnerships among the departments. The project will create a new, interdisciplinary curriculum model for a BSCS concentration in Social Computing. Such a curriculum will allow students in the field of computer science to learn about social computing and social computational systems, allow students in mathematics to apply mathematics to social computing, and allow students in sociology and psychology to learn about social computational systems. New courses such as introduction to social computational systems, mathematics for social computing science, and social issues relating to social computing will be developed. The curriculum and instructional materials developed by this project can be adopted by faculty at other colleges and universities. The project team will host a workshop at the ASE/IEEE International Conference on Social Computing. The team will disseminate instructional materials for the new courses and introduce the software tools that were developed in the social computing lab. This project will increase the educational and career opportunities for African American students majoring in computer science, mathematics, and sociology at NCA&amp;T State University.</AbstractNarration>
