    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: Life requires the production and use of proteins. Proteins are polymers of amino acids, and the amino acid sequence of a protein is encoded in a gene. To translate the genetic message into the proper amino acid sequence requires the presence of adaptor molecules, aminoacyl-transfer RNAs, in a cell. Twenty amino acids are commonly used in proteins. Each of the twenty amino acids has a corresponding pool of transfer RNAs (tRNAs). For an amino acid to be used in translation, it must be attached to its corresponding tRNA. For the amino acid asparagine, nature has evolved two distinct pathways for forming asparaginyl-tRNA used in protein synthesis. In the first pathway, asparagine is directly attached to the tRNA. In the second pathway, asparagine is synthesized on the tRNA itself. Computational analyses predict that Staphylococcus aureus and Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus each encode both pathways in their genomes. These studies will combine biochemical and molecular genetic techniques to verify that both pathways are used in these two bacteria, and to determine how dual routes for asparaginyl-tRNA formation are integrated into the life cycles of these bacteria. The research will provide insight into the evolution of asparaginyl-tRNA synthesis and the physiology of S. aureus and B. bacteriovorus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will provide three undergraduates each summer and academic year the opportunity to take part in scientific research that challenges them to synthesize biochemical data with bioinformatics and molecular genetics. The work will therefore provide them a strong foundation for success in graduate or professional school in the biomolecular sciences. The principal investigator will work closely with Skidmore's S3M and Schupf programs to recruit students from underrepresented groups. The project will also allow development of an experimental biochemistry laboratory course at Skidmore enabling additional undergraduates to take part in research. To expand scientific literacy and retain more women from underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines, the principal investigator and Skidmore undergraduates will meet with and mentor students from the Brighter Choice All-Girls Middle School in Albany, NY.</AbstractNarration>
