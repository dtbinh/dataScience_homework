    <AbstractNarration>Student Support 2012 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband,&lt;br/&gt;ICUWB2012&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Syracuse University is cosponsoring and hosting the 2012 IEEE International Conference on&lt;br/&gt;Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB2012). The conference will be accepting full-student papers and posters about&lt;br/&gt;student Research in Progress. Syracuse University, as the cosponsor and host, is planning to support&lt;br/&gt;designated student presenters. This proposal is written to request Student Travel/Support Grant to fund&lt;br/&gt;those students who will present their research papers at the ICUWB2012 in Syracuse, NY, September 17?&lt;br/&gt;20, 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This conference provides a forum for the latest UWB systems, technologies and applications in both&lt;br/&gt;microwave and millimeter wave bands. Wide scale commercial and defense applications are available&lt;br/&gt;using UWB technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;ICUWB 2012 will present contributions and developments in the UWB field covering a broad range of&lt;br/&gt;topics through oral and poster sessions, workshops/tutorials, exhibitions. In this conference, there are two&lt;br/&gt;venues for students to present their work: (1) regular paper and (2) student progress-in-research&lt;br/&gt;colloquium. Students who are currently pursuing their degree and have research they would like to share&lt;br/&gt;may participate in the Student Program by presenting incomplete research, currently underway. Research&lt;br/&gt;projects which are not complete, research proposals and conceptual or theoretical proposals are all&lt;br/&gt;welcome topics. Audience members will participate by providing the author with feedback and questions&lt;br/&gt;pertaining to the ongoing research. This experience will encourage further development and refinement of&lt;br/&gt;the student's research-in-progress and give presenting students the opportunity to network with&lt;br/&gt;researchers and professionals in the field of ultra-wideband technology. Presence of these experts will&lt;br/&gt;give the students chance for one-to-one interaction, discussion, and guidance. Moreover, supporting the&lt;br/&gt;projects of students related to UWB research and development will contribute to the future of UWB&lt;br/&gt;technology.</AbstractNarration>
