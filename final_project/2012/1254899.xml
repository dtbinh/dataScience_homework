    <AbstractNarration>PI: Tu &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1254899 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Butanol is one of the promising advanced biofuels being pursued by industry for the next generation of alternative fuels. However, cost-effective production of butanol from lignocellulosic biomass is still challenging. In particular, hydrolysate inhibition limits butanol fermentation efficiency. The overall objectives of this project are to identify fermentation inhibitors in biomass hydrolysates, to elucidate the alkaline detoxification mechanisms, and to improve butanol fermentation rates and yields. The specific research objectives of this CAREER project are to: (1) Establish quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) between the molecular structure and inhibitory effects of model carbonyl compounds on microbial fermentation; (2) Identify carbonyl compounds in real biomass hydrolysates and predict their inhibitory effects on microbial fermentation; and (3) Design carbonyl-based selective chemical reactions for detoxifying biomass hydrolysates to improve butanol fermentation with Clostridium acetobutylicum. The PI?s long-term educational goal is to train the next generation of scientists and engineers with advanced knowledge and research experience that will reinvigorate the national forest and biorefinery industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;This project addresses fundamental understanding of carbonyl inhibition in fermentation of biomass hydrolysates. The results forthcoming are critical for cost-effective biofuels production from biomass. The central hypothesis of this research is that the inhibitory effects of biomass hydrolysates on microbial fermentation are governed by the electrophilic reactivity of carbonyls to the biological nucleophiles, with that reactivity dominated by physicochemical properties that are controlled by molecular structure. This hypothesis is based on preliminary findings, which show an aromatic carbonyl compound can be detoxified through carbonyl aldol condensation between carbonyl aldehyde and glucose elonate. The understanding the structure-activity relationships between the molecular structure and inhibitory effects of biomass-derived toxic compounds would establish a scientific framework for removing inhibitors cost-effectively in biofuels production. By integrating computational study and experimental determination, new information will be generated to correlate carbonyl molecular structure to their reactivity and inhibitory effects on microbial fermentation. Building QSAR models to predict these effects makes an important contribution to biomass processing chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research addresses the national interest of developing sustainable alternative fuels from renewable resources. This research is complemented by multi-faceted educational activities involving interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students, with a special emphasis on underrepresented groups, and bioenergy curriculum development. The research results will be useful for design and use of manufacturing machines and equipment related to butanol biofuel. The results of this research will be disseminated through publications and conference presentations, and will advance scientific discovery of biomass-derived carbonyls and the fundamental understanding of carbonyl reactions in biomass processing. Successful undertaking of the proposed work is expected to lead to significant promotion of biofuels production, which will benefit the nation?s economy, energy security, environment and society.</AbstractNarration>
