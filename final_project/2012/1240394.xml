    <AbstractNarration>EarthCube, a major new NSF initiative, is focused on community-driven development of an integrated and interoperable knowledge management system for data in the geo- and environmental sciences. By utilizing a cooperative, as opposed to competitive process like that which created the Internet and Open Source software, EarthCube will attack the recalcitrant and persistent problems that so far have prevented adequate access to and the analysis, visualization, and interoperability of the vast storehouses of disparate geoscience data and data types residing in distributed and diverse data systems. This awards funds a series of broad, inclusive community interactions to gather adequate information and requirements to create a roadmap for a critical capability (data mining and algorithm/data analytic techniques) that will enable the development of EarthCube. The focus of the community conversations include exploration of present data analysis approaches and possible new novel approaches; data filtering; pattern recognition and machine learning as applied to geoscience datasets; and search algorithm identification and development. Intensive interaction will also take place with awardees and participants in the other EarthCube community groups and concept development awards. Broader impacts of the work include: helping EarthCube realize its potential to dramatically improve the infrastructure for science, actively engaging early career geoscience researchers in the process, and supporting investigators at an institution in an EPSCoR state.</AbstractNarration>
