    <AbstractNarration>The specific topics of this workshop will include (i) materials design and synthesis: optical and electronic tuning in materials design and synthesis, (ii) device physics: characterization and control of internal charge dissociation, transport, and collection in device physics, and (iii) device fabrication: interface engineering issues, new electrode materials, and printing techniques. The goal of this workshop is to review recent research progress and prepare a strategic report that can address key issues and five-year research plan for the development of next-generation organic solar cells with device efficiencies greater than 15 %.&lt;br/&gt;The specific intellectual merit includes (i) interdisciplinary participants from academic universities, government labs, and industries, (ii) comprehensive discussions on critical issues in molecular structure (light harvesting versus photovoltaic loss), morphological structure (charge dissociation versus charge recombination), and device interface (charge collection versus charge trapping) and (iii) interdisciplinary effort from materials synthesis, device fabrication, and fundamental studies. &lt;br/&gt;The educational impact will include the following aspects. First, this workshop plans to establish a website to publish the workshop presentations and reports to public to enhance student learning and training at both graduate and undergraduate levels. Second, this workshop will summarize the recent research progress for the use in future materials summer camp organized annually at the University of Tennessee. Third, the experimental results reported by this workshop will become public domain through designed website, which can be used by various universities to enhance class teaching.</AbstractNarration>
