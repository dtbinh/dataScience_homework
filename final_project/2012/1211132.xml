    <AbstractNarration>The need for improved understanding and development of more reliable means to identify and provide advance warning of tornado formation are key motivations behind the joint NSF-NOAA sponsored VORTEX2 (Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes) project. Field operations during VORTEX2 encompassed multi-platform field activities providing a wealth of radar and in-situ thermodynamic data within severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and their supporting environments. Following on a successful two-year multi-investigator data collection campaign, this research effort will focus on advanced physical understanding in three separate yet interrelated topical areas: (1) Specification of mechanisms contributing to the genesis, intensification and evolution of tornadoes; (2) more comprehensive description of near-surface winds in tornadoes and their relationship to built-structure damage; and (3) improved climatological description of tornado characteristics utilizing a growing suite of close-up, high-resolution observations gathered via specially-tailored mobile platforms. In the course of these studies, researchers will seek to increase robustness of prior indications of typical tornado behavior, including what may be a preferred scale and intensity for tornadoes, a suggested negative correlation between vortex core size and intensity, and an apparent lack of correlation between the strength of tornadic vortices vis-Ã -vis overlying in-cloud circulation within parent mesocyclones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this effort will include improved ability to detect, warn for and forecast tornadic events and thereby achieve decreased false alarm rates, as well as provide information that will aid structural engineers and emergency response communities. Collaborations will extend to multiple universities, and thereby support career development (including degree committee memberships) for multiple students.</AbstractNarration>
