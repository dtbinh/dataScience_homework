    <AbstractNarration>The project will investigate the commercial potentail of titania nanotubes for applications in solar cells, photocatalysis, catalysis, etc. Research in these areas by the PI over the last several years has identified several high-efficiency, low-cost technology-ready methodologies in (i) the development and characterization of titania nanotube anodes with ultra-high surface density produced via inexpensive and scalable electrochemical routes. (ii) synthesis of low-cost polymer hole-regenerators such as poly-ethylene-dioxy-thiophene (PEDOT) amenable to solar cell applications (iii) Titania nanotubes decorated with gold nanoparticles with extraordinarily high catalytic oxidation efficiencies thus demonstrating promise for applications in fuel cells, automobile catalysts, etc. Several advances in energy technology will emanate from this work: (i) tech-ready biocompatible nanomaterials; high-performance catalyst materials; photocatalyst and photovoltaic anodes with superior charge transport and solar absorptive properties will be developed (ii) the liquid electrolyte which is the main bottleneck in current PV cells/modules will be replaced by solid hole-conductors and (iii) an optimal integration of high-performance solar cell components will be achieved resulting in stable, low cost, high-efficiency solar cells which are amenable to large-volume manufacture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project may have commercial impacts with the establishment of several new contacts. The novel developments within this project will be patented and rapid tech-transfer measures will be taken. The research draws on a number scientific disciplines, combining materials science with photovoltaics, optoelectronics and chemistry, thus providing a unique educational experience for students including the participation of underrepresented groups, enhancement of infrastructure for research and education, and industrial outreach.</AbstractNarration>
