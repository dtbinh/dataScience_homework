    <AbstractNarration>This project is a collaborative effort involving Whatcom Community College, Western Washington University, and the University of Washington. The investigators are taking a comprehensive approach to growing an educated and skilled workforce in a field critical to the U.S. economy and national security. The approach includes the development of new information assurance/cybersecurity degree pathways that are replicable statewide, coupled with outreach to recruit students (including underserved populations) into the pathways. Forty faculty are participating in the project over a three-year period, and the project is likely to reach over 500 students during that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project goals and activities include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* increasing the capacity for educating information technology professionals in cybersecurity-related disciplines by creating new two-year and four-year degrees in information assurance/cybersecurity at the three partnering institutions of higher education;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* increasing the number of professionals in cybersecurity-related jobs by offering opportunities for students (traditional students, nontraditional students, veterans, and career-changers) to complete new, streamlined educational pathways;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* increasing interest in information assurance/cybersecurity careers and education among K-12 and college students by hosting information sessions and workshops for secondary students, and industry tours and guest speakers for college students and college mentors;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* strengthening partnerships between institutions of higher education through collaboration on curriculum development and articulation agreements;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* strengthening partnerships with local industry and employers by convening advisory committees, arranging student tours and internships at industry sites, and inviting industry speakers into the classroom;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* developing new teaching expertise in information assurance/cybersecurity, especially in high schools; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* increasing the diversity of the cybersecurity workforce by recruiting women, veterans, Native American students, and economically disadvantaged students.</AbstractNarration>
