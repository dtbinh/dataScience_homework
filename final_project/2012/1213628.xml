    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Ilya Zharov of the University of Utah will prepare and investigate novel nanostructured proton- and lithium-conducting membranes, in which ordered inorganic nanopores are surface-modified with well-defined polymer molecules carrying acidic and/or basic functional groups. The highly ordered inorganic materials displaying continuous networks of nanopores that will be investigated are silica colloidal crystals, inverse silica colloidal crystals and silica-coated anodized alumina. They will serve as solid matrixes providing mechanical stability and supporting the proton- and ion-conducting polymers. The architecture of these membranes makes them particularly suitable for systematic studies needed to understand the ion transport through polymer brushes inside confined spaces. Structure-property relationships will be determined for nanopores of different geometry and for polymer brush architectures prepared by surface-initiated living polymerization inside the inorganic nanopores. The broader impacts involve interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students, recruitment of underrepresented groups in chemical sciences to participate in the research project, and outreach to local elementary, middle and high schools through the Natural History Museum of Utah's Youth Teaching Youth (YTY) program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In practical terms, proton- and lithium-conducting membranes are key components of fuel cells and batteries, respectively, and the membranes that will be investigated possess unique features that are fundamentally different from the traditional polyelectrolyte or composite organic-inorganic membranes. Therefore, this research, although fundamental in nature, has the potential to lead to breakthroughs in energy technology.</AbstractNarration>
