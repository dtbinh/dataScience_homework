    <AbstractNarration>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place at the National University of La Plata (UNLP) on August 2014 in Argentina. Organized by Dr. Lou Kondic of the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) and Dr. Robert P. Behringer, of the Department of Physics of Duke University, the institute will focus on problems related to particulate media. The distinguishing feature of the PASI will be close interaction of world experts from different fields connected by the common underlying theme. The proposal implements an interdisciplinary approach to learning, necessary in the field of particulate media due to the skills from multiple disciplines that transverse the traditional boundaries, and includes techniques from engineering disciplines, computing, applied mathematics, theoretical and experimental physics, and biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PASI will integrate research and education by giving an opportunity to junior scientists not only to learn, but also to present their work to the international community, and interact directly with the leaders in the fields of research related to particulate media. In addition to this exposure the activity is further motivated by the need to develop better educational and research connections between scientists and engineers from the US and the countries of Central and South America. The proposed PASI will lead to establishment of professional and personal connections between researchers in various disciplines, and to new interactions via student exchanges, reciprocal visits, and development of jointly funded proposals. Results from the PASI, including videos and presentations, will be disseminated through a website where all the lectures will be available.</AbstractNarration>
