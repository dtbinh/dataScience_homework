    <AbstractNarration>The LSAMP Alaska Alliance is the BS STEM undergraduate portion of a comprehensive longitudinal model that starts with middle school students, extends through high school, into the undergraduate years, on to graduate school and into the professions. The project objective is to effect a systemic change in the hiring patterns in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by increasing the number of individuals on a career path to leadership in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LSAMP senior level funding will allow for:&lt;br/&gt;1. additional improvements to the undergraduate education experience by building upon the work we are doing at the critical junctures of the transition between high school and college and the transition from undergraduate to graduate school &lt;br/&gt;2. expansion of capacity for undergraduate research; &lt;br/&gt;3. building capacity to conduct international research projects; and &lt;br/&gt;4. strengthening LSAMP presence on the Alliance Community campuses.</AbstractNarration>
