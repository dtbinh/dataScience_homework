    <AbstractNarration>This award to Indiana University is from the Division of Biological Infrastructure in Directorate of Biological Sciences, and the Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate of Mathematical Sciences. The award provides partial support to an International Neutron Scattering Instrumentation Schools (INSIS. INSIS will provide a basic education in the design and optimization of neutron scattering instrumentation as well as, for a subset of the students, a more profound understanding of an essential component of all neutron scattering instruments, the neutron detector. The school will be held in Rome in July 2012 and is described on the following website: http://neutrons.ornl.gov/conf/insis2012/. Lectures will be streamed on the internet during the school and will be archived so that they are available for individuals who are unable to attend the school. Neutron scattering is a tool that allows researchers to conduct structural studies and provides unique information in fields as diverse as biology, materials science, chemistry and geology. For this reason, both the U.S. and Japan have recently completed the construction of major neutron scattering facilities and Europe is beginning construction of a facility which may be even more powerful. To make optimum use of these facilities, advanced instrumentation is required. Unfortunately, the number of individuals worldwide who are qualified to build such equipment is severely limited. NSF funding will be used to support the travel and accommodation of one U.S. Lecturer and up to 8 students at the school. The students will either be following a graduate course currently or they will be qualified young scientists at the beginning of their research careers. Special attention will be paid to ensuring a diverse student body, including members of groups which are currently under-represented in the scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to Indiana University is from the Division of Biological Infrastructure in Directorate of Biological Sciences, and the Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate of Mathematical Sciences.
