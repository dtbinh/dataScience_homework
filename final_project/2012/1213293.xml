    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor James V. Coe of the Ohio State University and his graduate student and undergraduate student researchers will be supported to develop methods for the spectroscopic study of particulate matter. The research will use metal films with arrays of subwavelength-sized holes to obtain plasmonic-enhanced infrared spectra of trapped particles. The Coe group will also work on developing, calibrating and testing a Mie-Bruggeman model for analyzing the spectra that are obtained. The researchers will study the spectra of airborne dust particles from a variety of environments and will investigate the production of arrays modified with latex spheres and inkjet spots. The researchers will also attempt to build an instrument capable of recording the spectra of single particles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infrared spectroscopy is an important analytical method that gives rich, detailed information about the chemical composition of matter. The work of Professor Coe and his student colleagues is aimed at providing scientists with information about the chemical composition of particulate matter. This research is important in that the small particles that the groups study are comparable to the kinds of respirable particles that can lead to a variety of health impacts. Besides the broader scientific impact of this research, the research students participating in this research will be exposed to cutting-edge research in analytical chemistry with a talented researcher and educator.</AbstractNarration>
