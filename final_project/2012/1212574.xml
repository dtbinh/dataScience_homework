    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Charles H. Winter of Wayne State University will develop new precursors and deposition methods for the growth of first row transition metal thin films. The project entails the synthesis and characterization of transition metal silyl complexes with optimized atomic layer deposition (ALD) precursor properties, solution reactions of the transition metal silyl complexes with complementary transition metal complexes containing other ligands to identify reactant pairs that afford metal powders, transformation of the solution reactions to ALD processes, and demonstration of copper/manganese alloy film formation and self-forming manganese-based copper diffusion barriers. This project will be performed in collaboration with SAFC Hitech, which will enable advanced ALD precursor evaluation, large scale precursor synthesis, advanced growth trials, and technology transfer to industry. The broader impacts involve training postdoctoral fellows and graduate and undergraduate students, enhancing research and education infrastructure by bringing together a collaborative group under the GOALI program that includes Wayne State University and SAFC Hitech personnel, industrial internships for Wayne State University students at SAFC Hitech, and the potential societal benefits of having new precursors and atomic layer deposition processes for first row transition metal thin films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thin layers of metals, only a few atoms in thickness, have many existing and anticipated future applications in microelectronics devices and functional materials. However, the required deposition processes are known for only a few, first row transition-metal elements. This research seeks to develop new molecular precursors and deposition chemistry that would enable the low temperature, atomic layer growth of these metals. Successful execution of the proposed research could enable practical applications such as self-forming copper diffusion barrier layers in microelectronics devices, magnetic random access memory device fabrication, and manufacturing of other devices that require thin films of first row transition metals. The technology from this project would contribute to the continued miniaturization of microelectronics devices which would have a broad, positive impact on the economy.</AbstractNarration>
