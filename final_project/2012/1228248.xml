    <AbstractNarration>Mendelian traits are governed by single genes, and methods to identify&lt;br/&gt;these genes have been remarkably successful. In stark contrast,&lt;br/&gt;complex traits result from multiple genetic variants that are&lt;br/&gt;individually neither necessary nor sufficient, often interacting with&lt;br/&gt;each other and the environment. Indeed, collectively, genetic&lt;br/&gt;variants identified to date for complex traits typically explain less&lt;br/&gt;than 10% of the phenotype variance. No unified computational and&lt;br/&gt;statistical framework has been advanced for organizing the discovery&lt;br/&gt;process. To date, a single strategy has dominated: static&lt;br/&gt;variant-by-variant analysis. In contrast, the investigators propose a&lt;br/&gt;new coarse-to-fine statistical framework motivated by the biomedical&lt;br/&gt;hypothesis that mutations contributing to a specific disease cluster&lt;br/&gt;in specific pathways, and in genes within these pathways. Simulations&lt;br/&gt;demonstrate that multi-scale, hierarchical coarse-to-fine sequential&lt;br/&gt;tests have greater power than conventional methods under this&lt;br/&gt;hypothesis. The researchers convert these heuristics into mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and provide a comprehensive analysis, both empirical and theoretical,&lt;br/&gt;of the trade-offs resulting from the introduction of carefully chosen&lt;br/&gt;biases about the distribution of active variants within genes and&lt;br/&gt;pathways. The new methods are applied to data from real genome-wide&lt;br/&gt;association studies (GWAS) with large cohorts to validate their&lt;br/&gt;utility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowing the genetic variants that contribute to cardiovascular&lt;br/&gt;disease, diabetes, autism, and other prevalent disorders would have&lt;br/&gt;great value in identifying drug targets, predicting people at risk,&lt;br/&gt;and suggesting personalized therapies. These diseases are not caused&lt;br/&gt;by mutations in single genes, however, but by multiple mutations that&lt;br/&gt;combine to disrupt multi-gene biological pathways. The investigators&lt;br/&gt;therefore develop a new statistical framework that begins the search&lt;br/&gt;for disease-risk genes at the pathway level, then sequentially narrows&lt;br/&gt;the search to genes within pathways and alleles within genes.&lt;br/&gt;Successful applications to ongoing human genetic studies involving&lt;br/&gt;tens to hundreds of thousands of people identify genes contributing to&lt;br/&gt;cardiovascular disease. More generally, the coarse-to-fine&lt;br/&gt;statistical framework has great value in the current era of "big&lt;br/&gt;data", with increasingly large data volumes calling for innovative&lt;br/&gt;statistical methods.</AbstractNarration>
