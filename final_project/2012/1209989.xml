    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Michael Witek of Northwestern University to conduct a research project, entitled "Analyzing seismic noise to understand the structure of the Earth's crust," during the summer of 2012 at Pukyong National University in Busan, Yeongnam, South Korea. The host scientist is Dr. Tae-Seob Kang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is an increased knowledge of the crust that would improve basement rock maps and resolve the locations of aquifers and economically important minerals. Better crustal models allow computational seismologists to better predict ground shaking and wave characteristics in the study region. Work on ambient noise analysis and Korean crustal structure would be an important contribution in continual efforts to separate the effects of mantle structure from the effects of crustal structure, thereby increasing the resolving power of vertically varying structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
