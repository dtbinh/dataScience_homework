    <AbstractNarration>This workshop will assemble a diverse group of scientists from around the world for a 3 day meeting in December 2012 to assess the potential of modern "omics" techniques to help unlock the genetic potential of crop wild relatives to enhance the efficiency of crop improvement. Crop wild relatives are increasingly recognized as critical to breeding efforts aimed at adapting agriculture to climate change. Genomics has the potential to help us better understand and more efficiently use wild relatives in crop improvement. This conference will provide a forum for (a) exploring essential gaps in our understanding of diverse crop wild relatives, (b) understanding the potential of genomics technologies to help bridge those gaps, (c) exchanging information and sharing perspectives among a diverse group of scientists, and (d) building an interdisciplinary network of researchers interested in using genomics-based approaches to exploit the wealth of genetic variation found in crop wild relatives. The workshop will help strengthen interactions among scientists from both public and private sector institutions so as to enhance global food security.</AbstractNarration>
