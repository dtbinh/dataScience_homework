    <AbstractNarration>Meta-algorithms are algorithms that take other algorithms as input.&lt;br/&gt;Meta-algorithms are important in a variety of applications, from&lt;br/&gt;minimizing circuits in VLSI to verifying hardware and software to&lt;br/&gt;machine learning. Lower bound proofs show that computational problems&lt;br/&gt;are difficult in the sense of requiring a prohibitive&lt;br/&gt;amount of time, memory, or other resource to solve.&lt;br/&gt;This is particularly important in the context of cryptography,&lt;br/&gt;where it is vital to ensure that no feasible adversary can break&lt;br/&gt;a code. Surprisingly, recent research by the PIs and others&lt;br/&gt;shows that designing meta-algorithms is, in a formal sense, &lt;br/&gt;equivalent to proving lower bounds. In other words, one can prove a &lt;br/&gt;negative (the non-existence of a small circuit to solve a problem) by &lt;br/&gt;a positive (devising a new meta-algorithm). This was the key to a &lt;br/&gt;breakthrough by PI Williams, proving lower bounds on constant &lt;br/&gt;depth circuits with modular arithmetic gates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will utilize this connection both to&lt;br/&gt;design new meta-algorithms and to prove new lower bounds.&lt;br/&gt;A primary focus will be on meta-algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;deciding if a given algorithm is 'trivial' or not, such as algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for the Boolean satisfiability problem. The proposed research will devise new&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that improve over exhaustive search for many variants&lt;br/&gt;of satisfiability. On the other hand, it will also explore&lt;br/&gt;complexity-theoretic limitations on how much improvement is&lt;br/&gt;possible, using reductions and lower bounds for restricted&lt;br/&gt;models. Satisfiability will provide a starting point for a more&lt;br/&gt;general understanding of the exact complexities of other NP-complete&lt;br/&gt;problems such as the traveling salesman problem and k-colorability.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal addresses both worst-case performance and the use&lt;br/&gt;of fast algorithms as heuristics for solving this problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploration will be mainly mathematical. However, when&lt;br/&gt;new algorithms and heuristics are developed, they will be&lt;br/&gt;implemented and the resulting software made widely available.&lt;br/&gt;This research will be incorporated in courses taught by&lt;br/&gt;the PI's, at both graduate and undergraduate levels.&lt;br/&gt;Both graduate and undergraduate students will perform research&lt;br/&gt;as part of the project.</AbstractNarration>
