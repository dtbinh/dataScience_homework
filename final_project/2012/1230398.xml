    <AbstractNarration>This is a fellowship project to carry out a statistical study, case studies, and simulations of electromagnetic energy transfer via ULF waves that will place important constraints on the amount of energy that can be transported via ULF waves globally and in different frequency bands. In situ estimates of the energy transfer will be made using electric and magnetic field measurements from the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions During Substorms (THEMIS) five satellite constellation. the results will be interpreted in terms of magnetospheric energy transfer modes using case studies and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. The work will be conducted at the University of Michigan in the Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space Sciences (AOSS) Department under the mentorship of Professor Mark Moldwin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have broader impacts as it includes a commitment from the team to disseminate their research to a broad audience at local K-12 schools and outreach events as well as develop new outreach materials that communicate the importance of energy transfer via ULF waves. In addition, Some ULF wave modes can interact with radiation belt electrons, creating energetic particles that pose a threat to satellites. The study of energy transfer via ULF waves, therefore, may have important societal impacts in helping to improve space weather radiation belt modeling.</AbstractNarration>
