    <AbstractNarration>Math Core Tools is a project from Western Michigan University that meets the urgent need of providing mathematical tools that students can use as they explore and learn mathematical concepts that are aligned with the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSM). The developers have repurposed and modified tools originally designed for an NSF-funded curriculum project (e.g., Core-Plus Mathematics), creating a suite of tools that supports student learning of mathematics regardless of the curricula choice. The designers provide exemplary lessons illustrating how the software can be used in the spirit of the new CCSSM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to provide easy access to core mathematical tools that help students visualize and manipulate mathematical objects. The tools promote mathematical modeling, representing ideas, calculating, decision making, and communicating mathematics related to Algebra, Geometry, and Statistics. The tools are available to all learners and teachers through the web site of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). The web site includes feedback loops for teachers to provide information about the tools. By using the NCTM website, the tools can be downloaded for use by teachers and students. The dedicated portal on the NCTM website allows supervisors to use the tools in professional development, teachers to use the tools as an integral part of a lesson, and students to use the tools for exploring, conjecturing, and communicating mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
