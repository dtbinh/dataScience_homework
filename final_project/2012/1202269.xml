    <AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this project is to investigate a tunable wetting mechanism on a smart polymer - dodecylbenzenesulfonate-doped polypyrrole (PPy(DBS)) - for manipulating liquid droplets at ultra-low-voltages (~1.5V). &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research will address fundamentals of wetting mechanism on a smart polymer surface, which are not well understood for microfluidic applications. In particular, this experimental study will provide insights to what extent Marangoni stress contributes to the overall droplet behavior, facilitating better understanding of inter-relationship between surface wetting and droplet manipulation. Further, this project will enable the development of lab-on-a-chip devices which can bi-directionally transport liquid droplets, but at orders of magnitude lower voltages than existing techniques. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Successful research on this tunable wetting concept will impact a wide range of microfluidics applications including on-chip sample preparation and handling, and lab-on-a-chip devices manipulating complex biological fluids, attributed to the low-voltage operation. In particular, it will enhance portability and in-field operation of digital microfluidic devices, since the system can be operated using standard batteries. In addition, this research will serve as the basis for educational initiatives with a special emphasis on recruiting and mentoring students from under-represented minorities, while forging institutional affiliations with organizations such as the Women in Engineering Program and Advocates Network, the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, and Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate. Furthermore, the program will work with the Center for Innovation in Science and Engineering Education at Stevens to extend this effort to K-12 outreach endeavors.</AbstractNarration>
