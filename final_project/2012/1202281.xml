    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to fabricate and characterize thin-film transistors (TFTs) and associated large-area circuits, with focuses on both improving device performance for TFT applications and understanding the mechanisms responsible for NW based device performance variations and reliability. The intellectual merit includes a well-integrated effort which will correlate the device and circuit performance to the materials and structures. The transformative nature of the program includes a focus on addressing overall issues associated with achieving operation at megahertz (MHz) to gigahertz (GHz) frequencies, in contrast to previous studies which have typically addressed basic materials issues and low-frequency performance. The interdisciplinary program will provide a means to utilize the developed thin film technology in two niche applications that are expected to have a large share of the future high tech market,namely flexible displays and radio-frequency identification chips (RFIDs). Two proof-of-concept circuits, a flexible color display and a super regenerative RFID tag, will be developed. The broader impacts of the program include the technological relevance of new device and circuit concepts for applications in thin film electronics, including display technologies and RF circuitry. The program will develop nanowire TFTs and associated circuits that can be fabricated reliably and consistently using simple low temperature fabrication processes. The program also includes an integrated education and outreach effort aimed at addressing challenges in nanotechnologyrelated education/training arising from the interdisciplinary nature of many of the projects, and at providing opportunities for participants from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
