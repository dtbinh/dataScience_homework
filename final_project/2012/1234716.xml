    <AbstractNarration>1234716&lt;br/&gt;Meissner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of biomedical optics has had tremendous growth over the last few decades. However, as investigators have made major advances in their own research, there has been insufficient collaboration and coordination between research groups. Researchers at different institutions across the country may be working in the same research topic, encountering and solving similar challenges, and achieving related milestones. Texas has a high concentration of researchers in the field of biomedical optics; however, the close proximity has not been capitalized on to encourage collaboration and communication about the challenges and successes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BioMedOptTex Symposium, held at Texas A&amp;M University (May 23-25, 2012), will bring together researchers from across Texas and the United States to stimulate discussion about working together to advance the development of optical techniques and technologies to improve detection, diagnosis, and therapy of human disease around the world.</AbstractNarration>
