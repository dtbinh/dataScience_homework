    <AbstractNarration>In modern automotive and avionics applications, the use of multiple sensors and especially real-time imaging sensors creates unprecedented workloads. From a computational perspective, multicore architectures have become mainstream; however, as a multicore chip is expected to process increasing volumes of data in real-time, the memory hierarchy becomes the bottleneck resource. In the worst case, task execution times can grow linearly with the number of cores in the system. This research aims at laying foundations for a modern memory-centric real-time scheduling theory that can effectively co-schedule the use of the memory hierarchy, the cores, and the on-chip network, including the I/O channels. According to the vision of Memory-Centric Scheduling, when the memory hierarchy is the system bottleneck, memory accesses should be scheduled to achieve high memory utilization. Performance of a real-time multicore system should be measured in terms of schedulable memory utilization rather than just core utilization. Ideally, the real-time constraints should be met as long as total memory utilization of all real-time applications (across all the cores contending for shared memory) is below 100%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential economic and social benefits of this research are significant since the developed theory will greatly increase the temporal predictability of embedded multicore software systems in general, while in particular reducing cost and time required to achieve the necessary safety certification of next generation avionic multicore computing architectures. As the new scheduling theory is being developed, key elements will be incorporated into graduate classes in real-time computing and then migrated to senior undergraduate classes.</AbstractNarration>
