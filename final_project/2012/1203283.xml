    <AbstractNarration>Doctoral Dissertation Research: Managing Teacher Labor Markets&lt;br/&gt;Ryan Seebruck, University of Arizona, Sociology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;I investigate the organization of education labor markets: how teachers' careers are managed and the effects this has on teacher distribution, school performance, and job satisfaction. I compare the public and private education sectors in Japan since the former features a centrally governed system characterized by compulsory teacher rotation (jinji idou) while the latter features a locally governed system lacking compulsory teacher rotation. I gather original data via a stratified random sample to test the following hypotheses: H1, the presence of jinji idou produces a more equal distribution of teachers (i.e., the public sector should have a smaller variance); H2, the distribution of teacher quality will be positively related to the distribution of school performance; H3, the presence of jinji idou produces greater job satisfaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This study could illuminate how the organizational structure of education labor markets, particularly a teacher transfer system, affects educational equality. This could benefit local and national societies by complementing extant scholarship on educational egalitarianism and organizational theory. Findings could provide an empirical basis for policy makers to consider how the governance of teachers? careers affects educational egalitarianism.</AbstractNarration>
