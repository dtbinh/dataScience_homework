    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Michael David Vincent of Louisiana State University to conduct a research project, entitled "Fabrication of a polymer-based high density lab-on-a-chip," during the summer of 2012 at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) in Ulsan, Republic of Korea. The host scientist is Yoon-Kyoung Cho, Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to use high-throughput screening (HTS) in a lab-on-a-chip polymeric device. The fabrication of a dense system of fluidic channels with lateral dimensions down to approximately 500 nm. combined with more than 100 fluidic channels is being formulated and tested for its ability to simultaneous image different biochemical reactions. Such a device promises to have many applications in industry, particularly in the synthesis of compounds with biological activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
