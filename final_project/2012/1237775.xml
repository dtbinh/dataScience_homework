    <AbstractNarration>This project will use the opportunity of a ship crossing the North Atlantic at high latitude to conduct a high-resolution sampling transect of mesozooplankton, marine "snow" (biogenic aggregates), and environmental variables from Aberdeen, Scotland to southern Greenland via a route south of Iceland, thence south across the Labrador Sea and the Grand Banks to Woods Hole, MA. Sampling will be done with the Video-Plankton Recorder II (VPRII). The VPR enables non-destructive sampling of fragile plankton in situ, and through rapid tow-yo deployments (continuous raising and lowering while under way), it provides high vertical (top 150 m) and horizontal resolution of robust as well as fragile plankton and aggregates and numerous environmental variables. The VPRII has now been deployed in several locations around the world, but there is no comparable data set for the far North Atlantic, an area of intense ecological interest. This opportunity arises from the delivery of a new research vessel, R/V Falkor, to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The budget covers technician time, travel to the ship, and supplies. The fact that ship time comes "free" because of the transit makes this an exceptionally cost-effective way to sample. This project will collect a major data set that will be available for analysis, and data that can be quickly processed (acoustic, hydrographic, automated image analysis) will be available to the community soon. Two Ph.D. students will participate in the cruise, adding to their training in oceanography and high latitude marine science.</AbstractNarration>
