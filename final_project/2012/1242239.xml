    <AbstractNarration>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in July 2013 at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile in Santiago, Chile. Organized by Dr. Alice E. Smith, Professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering and Dr. Jorge F. Valenzuela, Professor and Chair of Industrial and Systems Engineering, both at Auburn University, the institute will focus on the transport and distribution of manufactured goods to customers, known as physical distribution systems. Managing distribution systems in globalized business environments is challenging due to the increasing complexity of production systems and supply networks, traditional efficiency concerns, quality, storage and transport aspects, and holistic approaches involving sustainability, security, and human factors. Thus, the modeling and design of physical distribution systems require a mastery of cutting edge technical tools and understanding of new approaches to design and operation. The PASI will provide participants with educational modules on various aspects of physical distribution systems, with an emphasis on multinational distribution systems at both the micro and macro levels. The micro level addresses such topics as warehousing, material handling, and facility layout while the macro level refers to facility location, supply networks, routing optimization, and collaborative logistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PASI brings together outstanding scholars and students from throughout the Americas to learn about many technical facets involved with complex distribution systems. It encompasses traditional small classroom experiences, hands-on group projects taken from actual distribution systems, and intensive field experiences. Knowledge will be disseminated widely through first hand contacts and through an open access web page of all educational materials and project outcomes. As such, it will benefit many other students and early career researchers in the fields of industrial engineering, systems engineering, operations research, operations management, applied mathematics and logistics. Additionally, the PASI will promote sustainable international collaborations among senior and junior researchers of different countries and regions.</AbstractNarration>
