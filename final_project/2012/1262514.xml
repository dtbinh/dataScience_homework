    <AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to Oklahoma State University that will provide research training for 10 students, for nine weeks during the summers of 2014-2016. The program will focus on the interdisciplinary science in developing bioenergy and other biobased products. Students will be associated with the Biobased Products and Energy Center which consists of over 20 scientists and engineers representing a wide range of disciplines including microbiology and molecular genetics, plant and soil sciences, biochemistry and molecular biology, and biosystems and agricultural engineering. Students will be conducting full-time lab research as well as participating in seminars and workshops on various topics, such as the collegial work environment, responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process. Students will also be provided tours of other research institutions and local industries, such as the Weatherford Wind Energy Center. Students will gain experience in a wide range of facilities including the DNA/Protein Core Facility, Array and Bioinformatics Core Facility, and Advanced Technology Research Center. Core equipment available includes instrumentation to perform automated DNA sequencing and marking, electrospray mass spectrometers, surface analyzer, scanning electron microscope, and other state-of-the-art analytical machines. Students will be recruited from a variety of institutions, especially those having limited STEM-research opportunities and large populations of underrepresented minorities. Recruitment efforts will be multifaceted, including traditional formats plus videos highlighting students' experiences through the Center's YouTube channel. Students will be selected based on academic achievement, previous research experiences, interest to pursue a career in a STEM-based field, and desire to pursue graduate studies. Students will be tracked to determine their continued interest in their STEM-based field of study, their career path, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool available to BIO-funded REU PIs. More information is available by visiting http://bioenergycenter.okstate.edu/reu or by contacting the PI (Dr. Sarah Lancaster at sarah.lancaster@okstate.edu).</AbstractNarration>
