    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project involves an interview study designed to better measure innovativeness in engineering students. The project explores multiple factors that contribute to innovation in engineering and more specifically to student innovativeness. The study seeks to determine which factors are innate (linked to cognitive style) and which can be changed or enhanced in a well designed degree program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arises from the currently recognized importance of innovation in engineering on the prosperity of the United States. The project involves multiple stakeholders from different sections of the economy, and plans effective outreach strategies to disseminate results to these stakeholders. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>
