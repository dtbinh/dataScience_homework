    <AbstractNarration>Emerging technologies have led to revolutionary computing platforms&lt;br/&gt;such as computing clouds and many genres of computing grids. These&lt;br/&gt;platforms promise to make high-performance computing platforms&lt;br/&gt;accessible to the public. Realizing this promise, though, requires&lt;br/&gt;one to cope with the platforms' dynamic heterogeneity, i.e., the fact&lt;br/&gt;that their constituent computers' relative powers and speeds can&lt;br/&gt;change at unpredictable times and in unpredictable ways; for instance,&lt;br/&gt;shared computers may slow down or speed up significantly because of&lt;br/&gt;unpredictable changes in workloads. The research of the PIs is&lt;br/&gt;developing a transformative computing paradigm that will enable&lt;br/&gt;high-performance computing on these platforms. The new paradigm&lt;br/&gt;replaces traditional schedulers' attempts to accommodate the&lt;br/&gt;particulars of a computing platform---a goal that dynamic&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity confutes---by orchestrating a complex computation in a&lt;br/&gt;way that honors the relevant details of the computation's inherent&lt;br/&gt;structure. In this way, the paradigm increases opportunities for&lt;br/&gt;executing independent tasks in parallel (i.e., simultaneously),&lt;br/&gt;thereby completing computations faster. Preliminary assessments---via&lt;br/&gt;simulated competitions with common computation schedulers---suggest&lt;br/&gt;that the new paradigm often completes computations faster than&lt;br/&gt;competing strategies by double-digit percentages. The challenge is to&lt;br/&gt;realize the paradigm in a computationally efficient manner, and the&lt;br/&gt;PIs are pursuing a variety of avenues toward achieving such&lt;br/&gt;efficiency. Because of the complexity of dynamically heterogeneous&lt;br/&gt;platforms, this goal requires advances in the technology of both&lt;br/&gt;scheduling algorithms and simulation software. The PIs are uniquely&lt;br/&gt;qualified to produce such advances because of their complementary&lt;br/&gt;expertise in algorithms, applications, and systems.</AbstractNarration>
