    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests an Ocean Surveyor 150 kHz vessel mounted ADCP for the R/V Cape Hatteras. The current unit onboard the ship failed and per diagnostic testing through the manufacturer, Teledyne RDI, it was determined that the ADCP would need to be replaced. Additionally, this was confirmed upon consultation with University of Hawaii. The Cape Hatteras schedule includes a cruise for Michael Gregg, ORS, from October 31 through November 17 in which a vessel mounted ADCP is critical to their research. There are also at least two scheduled cruises on board the Cape Hatteras for 2012 in which an ADCP is a required piece of equipment. The equipment requested will allow the ship to continue providing ocean scientists with accurate and reliable data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>
