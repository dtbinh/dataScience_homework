    <AbstractNarration>SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a workshop on the Materials Genome Initiative. The workshop will be held at NSF in Arlington, VA in December, 2012. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Materials Genome Initiative promises to revolutionize the way in materials science and engineering is practiced. Many areas stand to benefit from this initiative, but in order to have a long lasting impact it is important for the materials research community to identify clear opportunities for development and compelling areas of research. The workshop will focus on the synergy between computational and experimental research. The workshop will bring together experimental, computational, and theoretical scientists and engineers with the goal of identifying such opportunities. This workshop complements past workshops related to MGI which largely centered on computational aspects. This workshop includes the interaction of computation with experiment and other important aspects in the broader context of how materials research is done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas of research to be covered in the workshop span a wide spectrum of materials science and engineering, ranging from semiconductors to polymeric systems. The candidate speakers have been carefully selected on the basis of their expertise, vision, and the influence that they have exerted in materials research. Additional participants for the workshop will also be invited in order to provide a forum for discussion that is inclusive and representative of the materials community at large. The key outcome of the workshop will be a report that will be widely disseminated throughout the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
