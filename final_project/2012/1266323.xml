    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division and the SusChEM initiative at NSF supports Professor Christopher Bielawski of the University of Texas at Austin to develop carbene-based catalysts that transform a broad spectrum of readily available starting materials (e.g, carbon monoxide, ammonia, dihydrogen, etc.) into valuable chemical products. The research builds upon the recent discovery of a stable carbene that, unlike the ubiquitous N-heterocyclic carbenes, is relatively electrophilic and activates molecules that possess inert bonds under mild conditions. As many of the activation processes are analogous to that of transition metals, the development and exploration of the chemistry of a series of electrophilic carbenes will be adapted in this research to harness their chemical potential and to promote a broad range of new metal-free, catalytic transformations. Beyond enriching the chemistry of carbenes while opening a new dimension in catalysis, this project contributes to our current understanding of chemical reactivity and structure, while establishing new tools for synthetic chemists.&lt;br/&gt;The development of organic alternatives to current metal based catalysts, which often require precious and/or toxic reagents and operate under harsh conditions, is attractive from economic, environmental, and sustainability perspectives. This project also contains a significant teaching development component that enhances the synthetic chemistry curriculum at the University of Texas at Austin, and promotes the mentoring and leadership skills of involved pre-college, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral members. In parallel with the aforementioned activities, several diversity-oriented outreach efforts are directed toward increasing the numbers of students pursuing careers in science, technology and engineering fields, especially among populations that are currently underrepresented, through engagement in summer research and other educational outreach programs. Overall, the synergistic research, teaching, and outreach components of this project are designed to inspire, cultivate technical as well as problem-solving skills, and prepare future members of our nation's workforce for employment in high technology areas.</AbstractNarration>
