    <AbstractNarration>1240458 (Hernandez). Considerable research is being conducted worldwide on biofuels and renewable energy. Successful implementation of specific processes will require different clusters of expertise and key components. The proposed event will be configured as panels of experts highlighting the configuration of networks necessary to produce renewable feedstocks, biofuels, and bioproducts. Five panels of experts will be configured to discuss (1) Biodiesel from Algae at a Power Facility (Kemper County, Mississippi), (2) Biofuels from Wastewater Produced by Pulp and Paper Operations, (3) Prolysis Oils and Biofuels from Mississippi Pine, (4) Bioproducts from Biomass, and (5) Solar Power Applications. Each panel of experts will be composed to 5-7 integrated presentations. The conference will inform biofuels stakeholders from industry, academia, and agriculture of advances in biofuels research, define the challenges facing the biofuels industry, and provide networking opportunities for people interested in collaborative research and/or employment in the ?green energy? arena. The organizing committee of the conference has selected specific renewable energy applications and will configure panels of experts to discuss specific technological and economic aspects in an integrated and sequential manner. The conference will aid in the dissemination of the latest biofuels research in the areas of catalysis, feedstock preparation, and resource utilization. The conference will also foster collaborations among researchers in industry and academia, resulting in the further advancement of biofuel technology. The conference will have a positive impact on all types of attendees: scientists and engineers will learn about the latest methodologies in biofuels development; students will have the opportunity to present research and network with potential employers and/or graduate advisors; attendees from the general public will become more aware of the science behind biofuels and become more interested in how they can participate in ?green energy? advancement. By providing key information regarding biofuels on both academic and industrial levels and facilitating the networking of biofuels stakeholders, the 2012 Southeast Biofuels and Renewable Energy Conference will aid in the development of fuel technologies that are both ?green? and sustainable.</AbstractNarration>
