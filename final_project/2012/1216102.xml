    <AbstractNarration>Funds from this award to the University of Rhode Island will provide partial funding for the Fourth International Radium and Radon Workshop, the latest in an ongoing international workshop series devoted to developments and new directions in the application and measurement of radium (Ra) isotopes and radon (Rn) as tracers in the environment. The accurate measurement and modeling of radium and radon isotopes is important because they have become increasingly important tools for determining fluxes of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) into the ocean, rates of mixing of coastal waters, residence times of water in estuaries, and interactions between surface water and groundwater. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will provide an important forum for a growing community of scientists to discuss the benefits and challenges associated with the measurement of radium-223 , radium-224, radium-226, radium-228, radon-220, and radon-222 , as well as models used to apply the results to environmental problems. Prior Ra-Rn workshops held in Monaco, Venice, and Jerusalem (listed below) have identified a number of issues related to the application and accurate measurement of Ra and Rn in aquatic systems. These and other issues would greatly benefit from discussions with the broader scientific community, as proposed for this workshop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The workshop would provide a timely and valuable opportunity to continue to develop discussions on the application of Ra and Rn tracers, provide scientific and programmatic updates, and foster international collaboration. At the time of the proposal submission, 54 participants from 15 countries had registered for the workshop. Proposed mechanisms to disseminate the meeting results include a short synopsis article in EOS, AGU/ASLO special session(s), and a special issue of peer-review publications to be published in a collegially agreed-upon top scientific journal. Dissemination of the meeting results in these ways would inform the broader scientific community, including students and early career scientists, of the latest developments.</AbstractNarration>
