    <AbstractNarration>Proposal title: Scaling Up: A Workshop to Explore Building Systemic Communication Capacity for Next-Generation Scientists&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal ID: 1255633&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Nancy Baron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Science communications proficiency is an important skill for STEM graduate students but is not a typical part of STEM graduate education nationally. At the institutions that do offer such science communications training, instructional approaches are highly variable, reflecting an absence of standards and evaluation metrics. The workshop will 1) inventory science communications training for STEM graduate students nationally, (2) identify high effective practices in science communications training with attention to curriculum, approaches, and evaluation, and (3) define a roadmap that gives concrete recommendations to university administrators and funding agencies for national implementation and scale-up of science communications training. The workshop will involve IGERT PIs, science communications trainers, science communications researchers, and individuals from national agencies and organizations with a high interest in STEM graduate student communications training. Products of the workshop will include a white paper to NSF that identifies best practices for science communications training and specifies a roadmap for national scale-up of effective practices; publications in the peer-reviewed literature and other media; and briefings of officials at organizations with capacity to foster changes in graduate education (e.g., NSF, Council of Graduate Schools, and AAAS).</AbstractNarration>
