    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, is a fundamental investigation of supported materials which focuses on oxide-supported metal/metal oxide nanoclusters, and supported zeolitic imidazolate frameworks. Such materials are promising candidates for applications in gas capture and storage, and hold potentially novel, unexplored reactive properties. The interaction of energy-relevant molecules with these supported materials will be probed using temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These techniques will shed light on some key fundamental questions regarding binding sites, relative binding strengths, and reactivity. They will also enable critical investigation of the chemical and thermal stability of the supported films. This work is expected to establish connections between material composition and gas binding and reactivity, enabling the prediction of structural and chemical changes in supported materials which will lead to enhanced reactivity and selectivity in gas binding. Furthermore, the bulk of this work will take place at the University of San Diego, a primarily undergraduate institution, affording an integration of materials chemistry into the undergraduate curriculum. Finally, a portion of the funds will be used to develop a network of female STEM faculty in the San Diego region (the "femSTEM" network) which fosters the retention and promotion of STEM women in academia, and mentors women transitioning to academia from postdoctoral and graduate positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of challenges exist currently in the areas of energy production and gas storage. For example, carbon dioxide produced from the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels continues to contribute to global warming. One potential mitigating solution to this problem is the filtration and storage of carbon dioxide using high surface area materials, such as porous metal-organic frameworks. The proposed work, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, is a fundamental investigation of such supported materials for energy-relevant gas storage and reactivity. Materials of interest include zeolitic imidazolate frameworks and supported metal and metal oxide nanoclusters. The goal is to establish relationships between material structure/composition and gas adsorption, as well as energy-relevant reactivity using surface science techniques. This work will heavily involve undergraduate researchers, and will also lead to the integration of materials chemistry into the undergraduate curriculum at the University of San Diego. A second important aspect of this work involves the development a network of female STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) faculty in the broader San Diego region ("femSTEM" network). The purpose of this group will be to foster the transition, development, and promotion of women faculty in the STEM fields of academia.</AbstractNarration>
