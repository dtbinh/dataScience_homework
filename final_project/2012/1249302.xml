    <AbstractNarration>This award supports theoretical research on topics related to gravitational waves. One of these is a study of the properties of extreme mass ratio binary inspirals where a stellar mass black hole orbits a supermassive black hole, emits gravitational waves, and eventually falls in. Such a system could be an important source for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) . Accurate calculation of the orbit of the stellar mass black hole and of the gravitational radiation produced require improved understanding of fundamental issues in Einstein's theory of general relativity such as the "self-force" on the small black hole due to the gravitational radiation it emits and how that changes the orbit. Another project is to develop a method to extract gravitational waveforms from large scale numerical simulations of (comparable mass) binary black hole systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Better understanding of gravitational wave sources and waveforms will maximize the discovery opportunities presented by ground-based gravitational wave detectors now operating and future space-based detectors. Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in this research. The PI plans to continue his program of public outreach and his involvement with nearby minority serving institutions.</AbstractNarration>
