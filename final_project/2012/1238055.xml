    <AbstractNarration>PROGRAM DIRECTOR'S RECOMMENDATION &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP 1238055 &lt;br/&gt;University of Arkansas &lt;br/&gt;Meller &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for a third five-year term (Phase III) of the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) at the University of Arkansas. CELDi is a university-based enterprise that provides innovative solutions for logistics and distribution excellence with its member organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of CELDi resides in the unique logistics and distribution models and tools that are created through Center research. The models and tools are tailored to the specific organizations and also generalized for dissemination into the academic sphere. As an applied research and education consortium, CELDi is a partnership amongst the National Science Foundation (NSF), nine major research universities and upwards of 30 member organizations in the commercial, military and government sectors of the economy. CELDi proposes to build on the success of its Phase II award and to capitalize on a Phase-III award to move from Good to Great and long-term financial viability by a)increasing its name recognition to provide a mechanism to grow CELDi, b)leveraging the substantial collective research expertise of the Center, and c)investing in current student researchers to better serve its member organizations and the logistics and distribution fields of the future. The success of CELDi's initiatives will be measured by the verifiable impact of the proposed centers research on commercial and public sector member organizations, the value created through synergy of our member organizations and member universities, and the professional success of all personnel involved in the center's endeavors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two main, broader impacts of CELDi. The first is demonstrating that a model of applied research conducted in member organization facilities is a successful technology transfer mechanism in terms of assisting the members to achieve logistics and distribution excellence. The other main, broader impact of CELDi research relates to students. CELDi has instituted a number of mechanisms that focus on developing student skills, from one-on-one mentoring sessions, group mentoring sessions, pairings of students and IAB members at lunches, a best-poster contest, and roundtable topics associated with IAB student connections. This direct impact on current university students is supplemented through RET projects that allow CELDi to also impact the next generation of university students. CELDi will also continue its efforts to increase the pool of talented students from under-represented groups by actively recruiting and engaging such students. Over the past five years, CELDi research has led to fourteen "CELDi Success Story Awards," which are defined as projects that "have significant, verifiable impact on the partnering organization(s)." Over the next five years, it is expected that over 20 "success stories" will be achieved and over 200 student careers will be enhanced through CELDi activities.</AbstractNarration>
