    <AbstractNarration>Climate simulations of pre-Quaternary or deep-time periods provide an important complement to simulations for the Quaternary. They consider a wider range of forcing factors, particularly for the composition of the atmosphere, than for Quaternary climates. Although the geography can be quite different from today, these periods can also challenge our understanding of how today's land distribution, topography, and ocean gateways influence the atmospheric and ocean circulations. These climate simulations also enable scientists to consider the role of various feedback processes in the climate system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining geological, paleontological and isotopic data with climate simulations provides invaluable information for reducing uncertainties in key climate concepts such as climate sensitivity. The Community Earth System Model (CESM) is a comprehensive fully coupled Earth system model developed by the scientific community. The management of this activity is based at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). It has evolved over the last few years from a model coupling the physical aspects of the climate system to a model that considers the simulation of aerosol chemistry, biogeochemical processes and ice sheets. Underway is the implementation of isotopes and other geotracers in CESM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To provide adequate support to the university community requires a liaison at NCAR. This position would provide support for configuring the CESM for various time periods of the geologic past, carry out simulations of time periods on supercomputers at NCAR, and disseminate model simulation output to the paleoclimate community as a whole. The liaison would also provide support for diagnosing model simulations. The creation and funding of this position would insure that a strong connection exists between climate modeling and climate data. It will provide a synergism that is essential for enhancing the climate sciences. This position would also enhance the services provided by NCAR to the university community.</AbstractNarration>
