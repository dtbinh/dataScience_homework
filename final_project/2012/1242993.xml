    <AbstractNarration>This project will evaluate commercial potential of the novel approach of plasma-based method of graphene. The technical part of the project will be focused on creation of an industrial-scale prototype system for graphene synthesis. The proposed interdisciplinary project has both fundamental and technological significance. The fundamental significance is that our understanding of the fundamental role of plasmas in graphene synthesis will be greatly expanded. The technological and scientific significance lies in exploring the possibility of using various means to control graphene synthesis in arc discharge, possibility to enhance graphene production yield and ultimately pave the way for graphene mass production and industrial applications. Many important sectors of the national economy will be potentially affected. Successful development of the technology for producing graphene in a scalable manner (to produce large volumes of such) would have an enormous impact on energy storage, electronics, aerospace, mechanical, civil, and biomedical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has potential for a variety of industries. Since graphene was first created in the lab in 2004, graphene has been considered a material with significant promise. The two dimensional sheets of carbon atoms are the strongest material known, and graphene's electrical properties make it a potential replacement for silicon in faster computer chips. Together with industrial partners, the team is developing graphene-based electrochemical energy storage applications. They will evaluate the commercial potential of the material and will optimize its performance based on specific requirements from potential customers.</AbstractNarration>
