    <AbstractNarration>This award to the State University of New York at Buffalo (UB) is for the acquisition of a hybrid sputtering/e-beam thin film deposition system. The instrument will be used by an interdisciplinary group of UB faculty from four different departments: Physics, Chemistry, Chemical &amp; Biological Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. The instrument is capable of depositing multilayer thin films combining metal, semiconductor, and insulator materials, in situ device fabrication and in situ characterization of a broad range of physical properties. It will enable the exploration of novel energy-related materials and devices, spin effects and materials in solid state devices, electronic materials and sensors, and optical materials. These materials and devices will contribute to applications ranging from solar cells and batteries, data storage to biological sensing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hybrid sputtering/e-beam thin film deposition system will foster cross-disciplinary interactions, and realize previously undiscovered synergies in research. It is an important addition to UB's material research infrastructure and is a key priority for the newly planned Materials Science and Engineering Ph.D. program as it will help to attract new faculty members from various fields strategic to the University. The instrument will be house in the Integrated Nanostructured Systems Instrument Facility where it will be available to the broader UB research community and regional companies and institutions. A large number of post-doctoral scholars, and graduate and undergraduate students will gain hands-on experience in the operation and maintenance of what has become an essential tool in modern materials research. A new course will be developed concentrating on nanoscale materials and devices. The PIs will work closely with Buffalo State College and UB's Cora P. Maloney College to involve underrepresented groups in research using the instrument.</AbstractNarration>
