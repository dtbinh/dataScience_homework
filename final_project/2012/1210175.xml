    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Priscilla Zhi-Xian Liu of University of Arizona to conduct a research project, entitled "Perception of Singapore English consonants by multilingual Singaporeans," during the summer of 2012 at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The host scientist is Dr. Ng Bee Chin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the research project is shown through the investigation of the connections between the details of linguistic phenomena and larger transnational language and sociocultural ideologies. This exploration of Singapore English complements existing research on Singapore English by providing a focused analysis of linguistic features and provides a deeper understanding of general speech production and perception phenomena by providing a case study on Singapore English.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
