    <AbstractNarration>Northeastern University is a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education and Research. It is also one of the four schools recently designated by the National Security Agency as a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Operations. Northeastern has produced 20 SFS students over the past 3 years. All of the graduates are placed in positions within the Federal Government and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers. One of the unique elements of the program is the diversity of students in the program. Of the 20 students, 5 are in Computer Science, 6 are in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and 9 are in Information Assurance. These students come with different backgrounds that vary from political science and criminal justice to computer science and engineering. The University, with its nationally-recognized Cooperative Education, is well-positioned to attract and educate strong students in cybersecurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SFS program at Northeastern succeeds in recruiting a diverse group of under-represented students to the program, and is committed to sustaining this level of diversity in future recruiting. Northeastern University is also reaching out to the broader community by leading Capture-the-Flag and Collegiate Cyber Defense competitions, and by actively participating in the New England Advanced Cyber Security Center, an organization composed of academia, industry, and government entities.</AbstractNarration>
