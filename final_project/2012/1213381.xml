    <AbstractNarration>In this research, supported by the Chemical Structures, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Kevin E. Smith from Boston University will use a powerful combination of x-ray spectroscopies to measure the surface electronic structure and chemical reactivity of complex multi-element metal oxides. The surface chemistry of these oxides is of fundamental scientific importance due to the significant role they play in catalysis, energy generation, and energy storage. While the chemical properties of many simple stochiometric metal oxides are well understood, this is not the case for oxides that contain multiple metal elements and have non-stochiometric and/or defective surfaces. The goal of this program is to understand the fundamental mechanisms controlling the chemical reaction of small molecules with the surfaces of such oxides under a wide range of physical conditions. In doing so, the results of this program will allow basic scientific knowledge of complex metal oxide surface chemistry to be applied to problems of importance in numerous applications, not least in solid oxide fuel cells, but also in solar and electrolytic water-splitting devices, and metal-air batteries. This program holds the promise of transforming the understanding of the surfaces and interfaces of complex oxide materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an ambitious research program that uses intense x-rays to the study the fundamental physical properties of a class of materials of great technological and scientific importance, namely compounds of numerous metal atoms and oxygen atoms. These materials are used in catalysis, in energy generation devices such as fuel cells, and in energy storage devices such as batteries. The program aims to produce definitive measurements of the chemical reactivity and electronic properties of these complex metal oxides, and thus greatly expand our understanding of such materials. It addresses important problems in renewable energy generation, namely measuring the fundamental parameters that control the efficiency of fuel cells and other energy devices.</AbstractNarration>
