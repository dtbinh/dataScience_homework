    <AbstractNarration>Parasitic diseases are of great concern for livestock, wildlife, and human health. Many parasites are transmitted between hosts when a blood-feeding tick or fly takes a meal; these arthropods are often called "vectors". With global climate change, vector-transmitted parasites are predicted to increase. There are many species of malaria parasites that infect reptiles, birds, and mammals very similarly. This project aims to study a model pigeon-fly-malaria system to understand the role of host defenses against a vector of malaria parasites. Host defenses against vectors may act directly by preventing vector feeding or by killing vectors, or indirectly through the immune system (similarly to the way vaccines work). Pigeons have at least two potential host defenses, one behavioral (preening) and one immunological (antibody response against the vector). The effect of each isolated defense against the fly, and whether the host defenses interact synergistically will be tested. The impact of these defenses on the transmission of malaria by the flies will also be tested. This work may further development of anti-vector vaccines if the immune system presents itself as an effective defense against vectors and the parasites they carry.&lt;br/&gt; Broader impacts of this research include training a graduate student in the fields of vector ecology and disease dynamics. Undergraduate and high school students will benefit from training, presenting their work, and some will be authors on publications of this work. Thus far six undergraduates (2 female, 2 international) and one high school student have been mentored and trained in techniques related to this work, with further student involvement anticipated. New control strategies against vectors are particularly exciting because vectors often transmit multiple parasite species; thus protecting hosts from one vector could protect against multiple parasitic diseases.</AbstractNarration>
