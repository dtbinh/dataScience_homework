    <AbstractNarration>The BioInformatics and Bio-Modeling (BIBM) conference focuses on leading edge questions in the field. The conference agenda is a varied program with topic paper areas, tutorial programs, and special interest group meetings that align with recent funding trends within the ABI program. In addition to research findings, the program also incorporates hands-on workshops of the newest informatics tools to be developed. The conference provides an interactive forum in which researchers can share ideas, learn new techniques, and forge professional relationships with other colleagues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A panel on Bioinformatics Training and Education at the conference will help to share resources and lessons learned in bioinformatics training and workforce development. The panel will feature representatives from academics, industry and government to discuss different career paths. The conference program also includes mentoring activities. The organizers will invite 20-30 (20 funded by this award) students and postdoctoral researchers to attend the conference, with a well-articulated diversity recruitment plan that targets gender, minority, and disability participation.</AbstractNarration>
