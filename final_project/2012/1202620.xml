    <AbstractNarration>Understanding the Molecular Mechanisms Driving Spider Adhesion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most well studied adhesion systems are the adhesive pads found in the feet of spiders. These pads are made up of hair-like bristles called setae. When in contact with a substrate the combined attachment force of these groups of setae can be hundreds of times the animal's body weight. Previous work has focused almost exclusively on the mechanical and kinematic aspects of adhesion, and not on the molecular interactions at the seta - substrate interface. This is a direct result of the difficulties associated with the surface characterization of biological interfaces. However, recent advances in surface analysis techniques now finally provide a way to fully characterize these surface interactions. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to use surface analytical techniques to construct a detailed characterization of the chemical environment at the surface of a spider spatula. These chemical characterizations will then be put into an evolutionary context - by comparing and contrasting the surface chemistry of setae taken from a range of spider species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon the successful completion of this highly interdisciplinary project - preliminary connections, between the behavior and mechanics of spider adhesion to the molecular interactions driving this process, will finally be formed. This molecular level understanding will lead biologist to expand on their current understanding of how adhesion organs evolved while also providing engineers with details that can be exploited in the future design of adhesives. The proposed project also directly fulfills the NSF's goal of broadening research opportunities by providing opportunities for scientists, from underrepresented groups, to learn the techniques and concepts of both biomechanics and surface analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the PRFB Program and the International Research Fellowship Program (IRFP) in the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
