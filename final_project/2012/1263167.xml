    <AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to Boise State University that will provide research training for 8 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2014- 2016. This REU program is supported by the NSF's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO REU program).This program engages undergraduates in field and laboratory research with a thematic focus of Raptor Research. The juxtaposition of Boise State University?s Raptor Research Center (RRC), The Peregrine Fund (TPF), Idaho Bird Observatory (IBO), numerous state and federal natural resource agencies, and the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (NCA) makes Boise, Idaho a hub for exciting and important raptor research. REU students conduct basic and applied research using raptors as focal organisms and participate in a core program that includes instruction on the biology of diurnal and nocturnal raptors, workshops on endangered species propagation, and development focused on responsible conduct of research, career planning, and scientific communication. The program culminates with an interdisciplinary student research conference that provides participants the opportunity to communicate their research to a diverse audience of students, faculty, scientists, and lay people. Weekly seminars and other activities provide for regular student-mentor and student-student interaction, and REU students become part of the Summer Undergraduate Research Community at Boise State University, joining undergraduate research students from numerous STEM disciplines. Recruitment occurs via digital and print media, and students from groups underrepresented in science and from institutions with limited opportunities for research are targeted during recruiting efforts. Students are selected for participation based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research in raptor biology. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the REU experience. Information about the program is assessed by exit surveys, mentor evaluations, and use of an REU common assessment tool.
