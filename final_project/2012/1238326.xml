    <AbstractNarration>The proposed planning activity seeks to undertake planning of the establishment of a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Smart Ocean Technology at the University of Connecticut and the University of Washington. The proposed Center seeks to promote and harness robust technological advances in computing, communication, control, devices, instrumentation and platforms that have the potential to provide persistent observation and exploration capabilities for aquatic environments. A distinguishing feature of the proposed center is the emphasis on integration of intelligence/awareness (e.g. smart) at various levels of underwater systems design in order to achieve the agility necessary for the desired robustness, persistence and cost efficiencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned center intends to focus on creating novel technologies in the areas of communication, power, sensing, and platform systems for the ocean application domain. The resulting systems and the insights they produce about the ocean will inform technical and policy efforts in areas of global impact such as weather/climate, food resources, and sustainability. The center plans to have a significant impact on students via interdisciplinary research engagement. Further, educational outreach to various community organizations (schools and science/technology museums, notably) is expected based on products - data, images and streaming video - resulting from the work conducted at the center.</AbstractNarration>
