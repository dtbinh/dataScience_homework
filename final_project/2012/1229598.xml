    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of this research are to develop a smart grid laboratory for modeling the power grid as integrated system of systems and analyzing its capability to transform into next generation sustainable energy infrastructure. The approach is to develop a research laboratory centered on the acquired real-time digital simulator that can perform scalable hardware-in-the-loop simulations with real-time power grid data and provide a platform for, device functionality and system integration testing, real-time power system studies, and conducting educational activities to develop next-generation workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is that this instrument acquisition will advance science and technology in the field, and enable students to grasp the physics behind power system dynamic phenomena. For example, real-time modeling and simulation can help to identify the effect of increased penetration of renewables on power system dynamics and methodology for improving power system reliability. The test bed provides rapid prototyping capability and allows hands-on research and training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is that this instrument acquisition will stand as backbone for a unique infrastructure for research and education, enabling sustainable and resilient modern smart power grid studies in the region, nationally and internationally. This acquisition will enhance economic growth, stimulating interdisciplinary research opportunities with increase participation of women and underrepresented groups, efficient transfer of research to the shop floor, and by developing highly trained workforce through real-time training of power grid professionals. Also, the proposed research and training activities will contribute to the power system security and strongly benefit our national agenda of power grid modernization.</AbstractNarration>
