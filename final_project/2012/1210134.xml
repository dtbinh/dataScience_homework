    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Taraneh Mojaverian of University of California, Santa Barbara to conduct a research project, entitled "Cultural differences among Koreans and Americans in perceptions and use of received help in the classroom," during the summer of 2012 at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. The host scientist is Eunkook Suh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining previous research on culture, academics, motivation, and social support, the current research addresses how interactions between providers and recipients of assistance may affect motivation in an academic domain, how differences in perceptions of unsolicited and solicited assistance may influence assistance use, and how these differences are influenced by cultural values. This research contrasts solicited assistance, or help that is given after the assistant recipient asks for help, with unsolicited assistance, or help that is given without previous prompting from the recipient. Research on the foundations of academic achievement has long looked for moderators of academic motivation. The influence of culture is a recent topic in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
