    <AbstractNarration>Combustion instabilities have emerged as the single largest challenge in the development of clean combustion systems for power generation, aircraft engines, and other industrial heating applications. These instabilities cause significant damage to engine hardware, reduce engine operability, and increase production of harmful pollutants. Understanding how flame's respond to acoustic oscillations is a critical, but poorly understood, problem at the root of the instabilities and the focus of this work. This work will utilize state of the art, high speed laser diagnostics to probe the unsteady flow and flame during oscillatory combustion and compare these results to predictive models. The project will directly support one graduate student, while also leveraging other funds to support additional project participants, including undergraduate students and a summer high school teacher. The program has been structured such that research, education, and service are simultaneously performed. For example, the PI will organize opportunities for graduate students to present their research to high school classes and explain the exciting applications of science and mathematics. This program encourages high school students to pursue careers in science and provides the graduate students with teaching experience and community exposure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge gained from this work will lead to improved understanding of the unsteady fluid mechanics of combusting flows, and how the flames in these devices respond to acoustic excitation. In turn, this fundamental knowledge will enable the design of robust, long lasting energy systems that are low emissions. This work has the strong endorsement and financial support from its industrial partner. The collaboration is structured such that the NSF program will be used to develop diagnostic tools, analysis approaches, and physical constructs for key flame and flow processes. The industrial partner and the PI will work in a parallel program to apply these diagnostic techniques, analysis approaches, and physical insight to actual low emissions hardware.</AbstractNarration>
