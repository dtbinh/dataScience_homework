    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the targeted infusion project at Saint Augustine's College is to increase the number of STEM majors that complete the baccalaureate degree and matriculate into graduate degree programs in these fields. There is a special emphasis on plant biology and environmental science, two disciplines where diverse students are grossly underrepresented. By exposing Biology undergraduate majors to courses and career opportunities in plant biotechnology and environmental science, as well as strengthening student preparation for the rigor of graduate study, the institution expects to contribute to diversifying the US STEM workforce in a meaningful way. Specifically, the project will provide for curriculum additions and revisions beyond the traditional emphasis on biological processes. The project will also support modernization of laboratory equipment and research internships for students at partnering research intensive institutions. Collectively, these interventions have the potential to yield significant outcomes that can be easily transferable to similar institution types.</AbstractNarration>
