    <AbstractNarration>This research study is a follow-up to previous studies performed by the NCMS in 2009, 2006 and 2003 to assess the cross-sector commercialization trends in nanotechnology by US manufacturers. The proposed study series aims to track the continuing evolution and maturation of the US nanotechnology industry, develop profiles of entrepreneurial activity and industrial clustering in nanotechnology, and identify common and specific concerns across multiple industry sectors. The 2009 study was performed during a major economic recession, and analysis of 270 complete datasets obtained from industry executives indicated nearly 80 percent of the respondents' organizations were impacted. The results also indicated that significant consolidation was underway among many nanotechnology startups due to constriction of investment capital, while even large manufacturers and end-users had delayed or trimmed nanotechnology product development programs to weather the recession in the short-term. The 2012-13 study will examine how currently extant organizations are positioned to scale and integrate nanotechnology advances into innovative products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this work should provide important insights through analytics into the level of "open-innovation" and vertical integration in different nanotechnology product sectors, and how industrial requirements are driving the translation of nanotechnology research breakthroughs to the commercial sector. The significance and benefits of the study lie in industry-wide dissemination of the "soft" metrics and best practices in entrepreneurial and commercial activities in Nanomanufacturing. This information can be used for industry benchmarking and policy planning at the local, state and federal levels. The findings will identify critical resource needs and propose approaches that could lead to the improved competitiveness of manufacturers integrating nanotechnology advances, and thereby promote the accelerated receipt of the technological and economic benefits provided by that industry to US society.</AbstractNarration>
