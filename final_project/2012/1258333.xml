    <AbstractNarration>The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is a large-aperture, wide-field, ground-based telescope that will survey the visible sky in six photometric bands. The images, alerts, and resulting catalogs will be made available to the United States and Chilean communities with no proprietary period. The LSST project was selected as the highest priority ground-based project by the 2010 US astronomy and astrophysics decadal survey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survey is currently planned to last for ten years and will produce a database suitable for answering a wide range of pressing questions in astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. The same data set can be used to characterize the properties of dark energy and dark matter; produce nearly instant alerts of detected optical transients such as exploding stars in distant galaxies; discover and provide orbits for potentially hazardous near-Earth objects; and catalog billions of objects with both high astrometric precision and unprecedented photometric depth. No other facility in operation or planned will have the simultaneous wide area and rapid temporal sampling to address these issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has already met the requirements of a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) of the full construction project. The present Cooperative Agreement provides the umbrella under which funding will be released for further Design and Development work, allowing the Project team to work towards the requirements of a Final Design Review (FDR) and to be ready for construction.</AbstractNarration>
