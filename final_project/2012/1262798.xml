    <AbstractNarration>The conference "Recent Advances in Algebraic Geometry" will be held May 16--19, 2013 at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The motivation behind the conference is the extraordinary progress made in the past decade in our understanding of the geometry of higher dimensional algebraic varieties, as well as in areas such as Hodge theory, enumerative geometry, or syzygies. It will bring together leading experts in Algebraic Geometry, to inform the audience of the major developments of the past few years, to propose new research directions, and to establish connections between different subfields. The following themes will be represented at the conference: the Minimal Model Program and its applications, vanishing theorems and multiplier ideals, derived categories and applications, Hodge theory and complex geometry, moduli spaces and enumerative geometry, commutative and computational algebra. More details about the conference, as well as the list of confirmed speakers, are available at the conference website, at http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~mpopa/robfest/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on some of the outstanding recent developments in Algebraic Geometry. The speakers have been chosen on the basis of their research contributions to the field, but also for their expository skills and dedication to the development of younger generations of researchers and teachers in mathematics. Some have produced many of the most important textbooks and advanced monographs in Algebraic Geometry in the last decades, have introduced many of today's algebraic geometers to active research topics, and have been a major force in developing the field as a whole. We therefore expect the conference to be well-attended by young researchers wishing to learn about, and then share with members of their groups, current questions in a wide spectrum of topics. The talks will contain a substantial expository and didactic component for this younger audience, for whom it is sometimes difficult to keep up to date with the rapid developments that the field is seeing.</AbstractNarration>
