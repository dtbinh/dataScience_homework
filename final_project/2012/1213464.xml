    <AbstractNarration>1213464/ Dan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Executive Leadership in Academic Technology and Engineering (ELATE) program will address the currently acute need for a stronger presence of women in leadership positions in academic engineering. ELATE will recruit, nationally, faculty in mid-career (at the associate or full professor level) from a broad range of engineering disciplines and academic institutions. Nominations of ELATE fellows must be submitted and sponsored by a leader in their university typically the Dean of Engineering - thereby ensuring institutional commitment to their career development and demonstrating institutional commitment to their promotion and success. The part-time, annually recurring, year-long program will be based on three components:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instructional: Fellows will build competencies in management and leadership skills, while working in interdisciplinary peer teams. Instructional topics will be introduced during three week-long workshops interspaced throughout the fellowship year, and built upon throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institutional: Fellows will conduct interviews with key institution leaders to get familiarized with the workings of their university, and provide them with institutional visibility. Fellows will also develop an Institutional Action Project (IAP) in conjunction with an institutional leader, to address a need in research or leadership and provide a path for career development. Examples of IAPs include the initiation of a new research center, development of a strategic plan for a department or unit, or the development of a new academic program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mentoring and networking: Fellows will be mentored during all stages of the program (including the institutional components) by senior engineering leaders, benchmark coaches, and peers. They could choose to stay in contact with their peer teams (using a conference line provided) and, as the program matures, with other ELATE graduates across the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These three linked components will result in a unique and effective leadership program that differs significantly from other, currently available leadership programs for engineering women. It is modeled after the highly successful ELAM (Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine) program for women in academic medicine, dentistry and public health. ELAM alumnae now number over 700 and include 50% of all women deans of dentistry and 25% of all women deans of medical schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ELATE will increase, nation-wide, the numbers of women leaders in academic engineering, while providing them with the necessary skills and a long-term mentoring and networking system. As a recurring program, it will help build over time a significant cohort of capable women engineering leaders.</AbstractNarration>
