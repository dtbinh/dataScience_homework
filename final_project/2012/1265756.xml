    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research in support of the 39th Northeast Bioengineering Conference is cofunded by the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program, and Environment, Health, Safety of Nanotechnology program, both in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems. This conference is a multidisciplinary forum for dissemination of advances in biomedical engineering, including biomaterials, drug delivery systems, and tissue engineering. This meeting is expected to enhance the interactions at all levels, and facilitate sharing of knowledge across interdisciplinary barriers. The conference serves as an open forum for discussion of new directions, ideas, and approaches in research and education. Additionally, this is expected to provide a setting to reinforce existing contacts and in establishing new collaborations. Sessions will be organized covering a broad range of topics related to Biomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The conference will serve as a forum for students to present their research and provides them an opportunity to discuss potential career choices with scientists from academia, government, and industry. The conference organizers plan to broadly disseminate the scientific presentations at the conference by electronic media.</AbstractNarration>
