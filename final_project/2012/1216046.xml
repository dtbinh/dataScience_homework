    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;11 July 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1216046&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;PI: W. Wilcock&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific Support item for the University of Washington for the R/V THOMAS G. THOMPSON and the broader Academic Fleet; namely a group purchase of winch level wind up-grades for compliance with latest UNOLS research vessel safety standards. This item will enhance safety, extend cable life and reliability, and provide greatly improved support capabilities to science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit: The PI addressed the Broader Impacts and Intellectual Merit of the proposed equipment specifically for the R/V THOMPSON and BARNES. The research projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit. The University of Washington vessels support federally funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment. During operations, the vessels routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography through the ?Teachers at Sea? program, real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and University open house events. All told, the THOMPSON and BARNES are scheduled to complete nearly 260 NSF sponsored days in 2012.</AbstractNarration>
