    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Kirstin C. Morton of Indiana University to conduct a research project, entitled "Correlation of electrical properties and physical structure of small, photoconductive wires," during the summer of 2012 at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Hideo Tokuhisa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to measure the local charge-carrier mobility of photoconductive, pi-conjugated organic microwires with conductive-atomic force microscopy. Photoconductive organic materials have gained attention in recent years for applications in photodectors, photovoltaics and sensors; and nanostructured one-dimensional (1D) organic morphologies are considered an essential component for the miniaturization of optoelectronic devices. This research promises insight into the photoconductive properties of synthesized microwires and to correlate structure with long-range charge carrier mobility. It furthers two long-term aims: to correlate physical properties of one-dimensional self-assembled organic polymers with molecular design and to further realization of a photoconductive gel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
