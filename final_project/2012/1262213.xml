    <AbstractNarration>For more than four decades, the Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium has been an annual conference designed to bring together geomorphologists from across the disciplines of geology, geography, and environmental engineering in order to enable them to exchange research results, become aware of new techniques, explore special themes, identify future opportunities, and enhance collaborative networks. The 44rd Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium will be held in October 2013 on the campus of New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, New Jersey. The goal of this symposium will be to assess the state of knowledge of coastal landforms and habitats and identify opportunities for integrated research. Key themes to be addressed are the response of coastal landforms and habitats to future increased magnitude and frequency of episodic events and changes in sea level; the effect of these changes on the resilience of these environments; and ways to restore or maintain landforms and habitats and their geomorphic and biologic linkages. Activities undertaken at the conference will be three sessions of invited oral presentations; a poster session to enable other professionals and graduate students to present their research in geomorphology; and a field trip to nearby coastal areas, including many that were damaged by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, that will provide perspective on key issues and facilitate scholarly dialog during the meeting. The conference proceedings will be published in a special volume of a leading journal. NSF funding will provide support to facilitate the involvement of students and invited presenters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2013 Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium will provide a forum to help integrate research among coastal geomorphologists who are housed in a range of different academic departments, including geography, geology, civil engineering, marine sciences, oceanography, and environmental sciences. Given the tight coupling among abiotic and biotic systems in the coastal zone, the symposium will increase interactions among geomorphologists and other physical sciences as well as biologists and ecologists working in intertidal, dune, and wetland environments. The symposium also will facilitate interaction with practitioners changed with responsibility for maintaining coastal landforms and habitats in the face of natural and human-induced stressors.</AbstractNarration>
