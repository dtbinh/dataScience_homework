    <AbstractNarration>This award is to support an International Chapman Conference on Longitude and Hemispheric Dependence of Space Weather. This conference will bring together an international group of heliophysics scientists to plan and discuss current and needed observations at mid and low latitudes in the African longitude sector, a region that has never been explored in detail using ground-based instruments. Strong interaction between scientists from instrument donors and host institutes is crucial in order to have successful instrument deployment and continuous data retrieval process. The conference will focus on at least six main science topics (1) Hemispherical Dependence of Magnetospheric Energy Injection, (2) Longitude and Hemispheric Dependence of Storm-Enhanced Densities (SED), (3) Response to New Time-History of Solar Flares, (4) Quiet-Time Longitude Spatial Structure, (5) Temporal Response to the Lower-Atmosphere Disturbances, and (6) Climatology of TEC/Scintillation in Different Longitude Sectors. For the United States this conference will provide great opportunity for young scientists and graduate students to meet international expertise and earn international experience for their future international collaboration. In Africa, this conference will create opportunities for undergraduate students to enhance their inspiration to space science and perform research activities in the future within their own countries.</AbstractNarration>
