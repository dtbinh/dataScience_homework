    <AbstractNarration>Although much of the world's biodiversity exists in the rainforest canopy, little is known about the factors that maintain that diversity or cause it to vary across the landscape. Quantifying such factors is important because the structure of tropical forests is rapidly changing. In particular, the abundance of one major canopy component " lianas (woody vines) " is increasing due to disturbance and climate change. Because lianas physically connect neighboring trees, changes in their abundance should affect the distribution, behavior, and diversity of non-flying animals that live in the canopy. This project tests that hypothesis in Panama by creating a large-scale experiment in which lianas are added or removed from some forest plots and not from others. The project focuses on the response of ants because they are conspicuous, abundant, and play important ecological roles in forests. The research specifically addresses three interrelated questions. First, how does the physical connectivity provided by lianas affect ant diversity in tree crowns? Second, do lianas help restore canopy ant communities in forests that have been cut or otherwise disturbed? Finally, do different ant species prefer to use different types of lianas, and why? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tropical rainforests are the world's best classroom for studying biodiversity, and this project provides outstanding opportunities for students at the University of Louisville to gain valuable first-hand research experience in an international setting. Likewise, local K-12 teachers will collect data in Panama while developing curricula on rainforest conservation for use during the school year. Because the field site is a popular tourist destination, the project provides a unique opportunity for participants to interact regularly with the general public. Prior research on rainforest canopies has attracted international media attention, and this project is expected to generate similar public interest. Finally, the work will reveal how changes in tropical forest structure may shape canopy biodiversity over the next several decades.</AbstractNarration>
