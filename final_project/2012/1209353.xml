    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Albert Medina of University of California, Los Angeles to conduct a research project, entitled "Investigating flight enhancement in flexible flapping wings," during the summer of 2012 at Seoul National University in Seoul, Gwanak, Korea. The host scientist is Professor Haecheon Choi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flapping wing flight has garnered much attention in the past decade driven by our desire to understand capabilities observed in nature, such as in airborne insects and to develop agile small-scale aerial vehicles with similar capabilities. Nature has demonstrated the breadth of maneuverability achievable with flapping wings. A wing of an insect undergoes significant bending and twisting as it flaps. However, the aerodynamic role of this elastic deformation is still poorly understood. In order to illuminate this role, this study focuses on the mechanics of a three-dimensional flexible flapping wing and uses numerical simulations to examine the effect of orientations of flexion lines in a model wing, over a broad range of flapping conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
