    <AbstractNarration>Gamma-ray astrophysics is a rapidly evolving field that has experienced a huge development during the last five years with the successes of a new generation of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes, such as VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System), located in southern Arizona, and the launch of the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope. Very high energy (VHE, with energies above 100 GeV) gamma-ray observations sample the sky at the highest photon energies, pointing towards the most extreme cosmic accelerators. The mechanisms by which particles are accelerated and produce VHE gamma-rays are of great interest because of the extreme environments where such acceleration takes place: strong radiation fields (pulsars), shock acceleration (SNRs) or accretion powered relativistic jets (blazars).The exponentially increasing numbers of detected sources, together with the improved quality of observations, are dramatically improving our knowledge of the most extreme processes in the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides operational funding for scientists at Barnard College to carry out high energy astrophysics studies with VERITAS, an array of four large imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes that has been fully operational since spring 2007. VERITAS represents a dramatic step forward in the study of extreme astrophysical processes in the universe, and is providing high-quality gamma-ray observations and an increasing number of source detections. The PI will contribute by participating in observing campaigns, carrying out scientific data analysis, and working on code development for improvements to VERITAS analysis techniques. In particular, the PI will focus on the study of extragalactic sources such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) of the blazar class, as well as Galactic sources, and unidentified GeV-TeV sources, including both archival and new multi-wavelength studies, in order to study the nature of particle acceleration in these objects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The Barnard Group expects to play a strong role in outreach efforts to K-12 students. As a Barnard College faculty member, the PI is able to reach a broad audience of high school girls interested in science by participating in college-sponsored science lectures such as the Saturday Science Seminars. The PI's research at Barnard College, a 4-year liberal arts school for women, has significant impact in influencing women in the physical sciences, and the PI will continue to be a mentor to undergraduate women in astrophysics research.</AbstractNarration>
