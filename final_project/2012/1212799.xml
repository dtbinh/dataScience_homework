    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Peter J. Stang of the University of Utah investigates coordination-driven self-assembly of 2D metallacycles and 3D metallacages. Specifically, heterligated Pt-complexes, involving carboxylate and pyridyl ligands, will be studied that allow the formation of a greater variety and more complex supramolecular assemblies. Multi-component self-assembly, as well as the interconversion of homoligated pyridyl architectures with heteroligated systems, will be examined. The use of flexible ligands and heteroligated, flexible multi-component assemblies will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will advance our fundamental understanding of how simple molecules spontaneously self-assemble into complex nanoscale systems. This work could have significant impact upon nanoscience and nanotechnology and, in particular, future "bottom up" manufacturing. It may also provide new materials with novel properties and functions such as sensors, catalysts, etc. of importance in the chemical industry. The broader impact also involves training postdoctoral researchers and graduate and undergraduate students in supramolecular self-assembly. These researchers will also be mentored in the dissemination of research results via presentations at major conferences and publications in premier peer reviewed, scientific journals.</AbstractNarration>
