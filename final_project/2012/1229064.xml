    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 12-29064&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Camacho, Carlos J; Chong, Lillian T&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI/Acq.: Computational Resources for Research in Computational and Systems Biology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, acquiring a computational instrument, fosters interdisciplinary collaborations and training that promote breakthroughs in the biological sciences. The project is lead by the Department of Computational and Systems Biology (DCSB) in conjunction with the joint Ph.D. program between two institutions in the area: Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon Universities. The acquisition, a state-of-the-art 57-node 3392 core computing cluster, is dedicated to research and development of applications and the dissemination of new computational methods. The cluster supports the following research projects:&lt;br/&gt;- Novel molecular methods to access biological timescales of interest; &lt;br/&gt;- Deep-sequencing technologies for high throughput ?omic? data collection; and, &lt;br/&gt;- Methods to leverage high-resolution multi-modal biomedical images/videos in basic research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts should be felt both regionally and nationally. At the involved institutions, the research initiatives the incorporation of developed applications in teaching modules for use at local city high schools, as well as in undergraduate and graduate courses. Access to dedicated computational resources will provide valuable hands on experiences for students. More broadly, the software developed exploits the new computational resources that will be made available to other researchers nationwide.</AbstractNarration>
