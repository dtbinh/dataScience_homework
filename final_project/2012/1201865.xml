    <AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this program is to develop a luminescent infrared sensor that combines ultra high sensitivity and high selectivity while requiring minimal alignment compatible with field use. This sensor will permit to rapidly detect trace quantities of molecular species in the field such as hospitals, airports, commercial borders or on the battleground and will have direct implications for health care, law enforcement and national security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit of this research resides in providing the first demonstration of a label free yet highly selective and highly sensitive optical sensor for molecular detection. The proposed sensor will reach unprecedented sensitivity while providing spectral resolution identical to conventional FTIR. This research will also provide new insights on the fundamental interaction of infrared light with resonant molecular vibrational modes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broader impacts of this research reside in its potential for developing novel sensors with direct applications in health-care, defense and homeland security. High sensitivity sensing of trace analytes has many applications ranging from breath analysis to detection of explosives or illicit substances. The proposed sensor can also be operated in solution and has very promising potential in bio-sensing for detecting and monitoring the metabolism of single microorganisms such as cells, virus or bacteria. It is therefore expected that this research will have a very broad societal impact. In addition this research will be integrated into several educational and outreach activities with an emphasis on under-represented groups and international education.</AbstractNarration>
