    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project investigates students' ability to generate ideas (ideation) as they learn engineering design. Ideation is a critical skill for all engineers as they explore problem spaces and develop both short-term and long-term solutions to societal problems. The project investigates three key factors hypothesized to contribute to students' idea generation capability, and explores the interrelation between the factors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arise from the potential to support ideation flexibility among engineering practitioners, giving greater capabilities for engineering educators to support and direct ideation in engineering degree programs. The investigators have proposed an ambitious plan to ensure that the research results are broadly disseminated to engineering faculty members. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.</AbstractNarration>
