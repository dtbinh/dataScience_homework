    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Oyindamola David Oluwatimi of Purdue University to conduct a research project, entitled "Testing mobile devices for security flaws," during the summer of 2012 at Soonchunhyang University in South Korea. The host scientist is Dr. Kangbin Yim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in a software environment for the assessment of cyber-attack vulnerabilities of the Android mobile platform. This environment enables a systematic approach for exposing the intrinsic vulnerabilities of the Android operating system. The vulnerability assessment of smartphones promises to point out distinct flaws in software and hardware designs on these devices. KNowing the flaws makes it possible for developers, manufacturers, and the research community to find solutions to solve existing problems, as well as providing preventive measures for future attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
