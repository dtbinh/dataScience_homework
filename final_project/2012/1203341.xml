    <AbstractNarration>Ecological restoration is a set of scientific practices, methods, and bodies of knowledge used to re-create functional, historical ecosystems. Practitioners consider ecological restoration an inclusive conservation paradigm and advocate broad public participation, but in practice, public engagement in projects can be limited by volunteers' initial understanding of ecological theory and restoration techniques, especially when high-tech methods are used. The Chicago Botanic Garden's decision to employ genetic technology into its ecological restoration efforts provide a special challenge for public participation in the production of expert knowledge and restored landscapes. This doctoral dissertation research project will examine the conduct of restoration projects at the Chicago Botanic Garden in order to explores how the engagement of restorationists with genetic technology provides different opportunities and barriers to public participation in restoration processes. The doctoral student will seek answers to the following questions: (1) How do botanical scientists and restoration participants use genetic technologies to decide which plants are included in native ecosystem restorations? (2) How do these practices define who should use or make knowledge about native plants and their restorations? (3) How do scientists and volunteers use genetic concepts to facilitate social interactions during the restoration process? The student will use semi-structured interviews and participant observation with geneticists, restorationists, and volunteers to generate information about discontinuities and connections between expert and citizen scientists in the restoration process. He will identify the specific contributions of volunteers to restoring and producing knowledge about native landscapes and assess the degree to which the use of genetic technology affects public participation in restoration projects, with special emphasis given to identifying what role genetic technology plays in interactions between experts and non-experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will analyze the potential for the emerging ecological restoration approach to include volunteers in knowledge-making practices. Because the Chicago Botanic Garden has emerged as a model for botanical garden-led conservation programs, its promotion of high-tech restoration practices and commitment to public participation make it likely that citizen scientists will have a voice in shaping future genetic restoration practices. This project will help identify the broader participatory potential for restoration programs through its examination of the Chicago Botanic Garden's social and scientific experiments. The project will bring together ecologists, social scientists, and non-experts/citizen scientists to critically reflect on the benefits and consequences of genetic restoration practices on volunteer participation. This research will elucidate how the public-science interface can be made more inclusive and responsive to volunteer restorationists, their knowledge, and their site-specific restoration visions. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.</AbstractNarration>
