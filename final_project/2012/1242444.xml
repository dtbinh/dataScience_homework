    <AbstractNarration>The Buenos Aires Semester in Computability, Complexity and Randomness will be an international gathering of Mathematicians and Computer Scientists from January to June 2013. It will be held at the Departamento de Computaci√≥n, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales de la Universidad de Buenos Aires. We anticipate between eight and ten researchers will be in residence for the entire period, accompanied by a similar number of graduate students. We also expect shorter visits, of two to four weeks, by another eight to ten researchers. There will be an intense and sustained research effort in computability theory, randomness, computable structures and reverse mathematics. The semester will bring together many of the area's most active researchers over an extended interval, allowing for a level of collaboration that is not usually possible and the accelerated progress that arises from such continuous interaction. In addition to the research effort, there will be a focus on training graduate students and disseminating recent research. We will organize a graduate-level course on Combinatorics, Complexity and Logic taught by Ted Slaman; a topics seminar in which all of the long term participants, including the graduate students, will take turns presenting advanced material; a weekly seminar on individual research interests and related open problems; and a regional seminar that will feature South American logicians. The NSF funding will primarily be used to support the participation of junior US researchers: graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty.</AbstractNarration>
