    <AbstractNarration>The University of Hawaii at Hilo is a geographically- isolated, minority-serving institution with a principal focus on undergraduates. The primary objectives of this ADVANCE project are to conduct data collection, examine trends in the data, recommend policy changes and disseminate relevant information all related to the status of STEM women faculty on their campus. To accomplish these objectives, several relevant strategies are proposed that include surveys, focus groups, institutional data analysis, establishing a web page, and forming a peer group of existing ADVANCE institutions. It is noted that the PIs specifically intend to explore the ways in which the needs of STEM women faculty on their campus and the elements of their institutional climate are different from institutions well-represented in the ADVANCE portfolio (e.g., large, research intensive, predominately white). They provide measureable goals to increase the representation of women to 40% and increase representation of women in leadership to 25%.</AbstractNarration>
