    <AbstractNarration>PI: Bandaru V. Ramarao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: State University of New York, College of Environmental Science and Forestry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Travel &amp; Symposium Grant: Joint Symposium on Forest Based Biorefinery Technologies&lt;br/&gt;International Conference on Biomass-Energy Technologies (ICBT2012)&lt;br/&gt;Nanjing, China October 22-24, 2012. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant is to provide funding to about 12 academic researchers from the USA to participate and present papers at the Joint Symposium on Forest Based Biorefinery Technologies and International Conference on Biomass-Energy Technologies, ICBT 2012 in Nanjing, China, October 22-24, 2012. The symposium aims to provide a communication and exhibition platform for experts, scholars, and entrepreneur in the biomass energy field. The delegates will include not only renowned experts, scholars, and government officials, but also company executives and professionals of investment institutions in Asia, Europe, and the United States. At this event they will discuss and exchange their ideas on ?hot spots??novel technologies?and commercial development so as to encourage cooperative research on biomass energy technologies between China and other countries, and promote the integration of the Chinese biomass energy industry with international enterprises and investment institutions. This conference will also provide new development opportunities for international biomass energy institutions and enterprises. The U.S. team including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will investigate international collaborative opportunities at the symposium. This symposium will fill a critical need and bring focus to joint efforts between USA and China on feedstock supply, conversion technologies, kinetics and reaction engineering of biomass conversions, separation and purification processes and novel bioproducts and materials in the context of forest products based biorefineries.</AbstractNarration>
