    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professor Jianfeng Jiang of Yeshiva University will study the reaction of nitrogen monoxide and carbon monoxide in the presence of double metal cyanides (DMC) for the potential application as emission control catalysts. The proposed study will start with the exploration of the synthesis of first row transition metal mixed cyanide/carbon monoxide complexes that are also of fundamental interest. Afterwards, studies of the reactivity of the carbon monoxide-coordinating metal cyanides or DMCs with nitrogen monoxide/dinitrogen monoxide will follow. The studies will also include analysis of nitrogen monoxide/dinitrogen monoxide with carbon monoxide in the presence of DMCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is relevant because of the possibility of preparing new carbon monoxide-coordinating metal cyanides, new types of DMCs and high temperature stable carbon monoxide-coordinating polymers, and the potential for developing alternative emission control catalysts. For example, if the reduction of nitrogen monoxide/dinitrogen monoxide to dinitrogen by carbon monoxide is greatly accelerated by a DMC, this DMC can be used to replace precious rhodium, platinum and palladium metal inside catalytic converters. In addition, undergraduate students who participate in the research will benefit by having first-hand research experience, working on solving problems directly related to our environment, manuscript writing and communicating results in formal presentations.</AbstractNarration>
