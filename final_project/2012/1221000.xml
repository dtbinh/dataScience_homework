    <AbstractNarration>NSF funds will be used to support (registration and travel) the attendance of junior and early career scientists at the 2012 Materials and Mechanisms of Superconductivity Conference (M2S 2012). This conference, occurring every three years, brings together world experts and young scientists to discuss open questions in the fundamental physics and applications of superconductors and to disseminate the latest theoretical and experimental research results in superconductors and related novel materials. It represents a training ground essential to maintaining U.S. leadership in this technologically important area. This conference will focus on key unanswered questions in high-temperature cuprate superconductors, high-temperature iron-based superconductors, topological superconductors, organic superconductors, and heavy-electron superconductors. The discovery of new materials and novel technological applications for electronic devices and for energy transmission and storage will be emphasized. There will be special sessions on superconductivity and energy, and outreach sessions, including an evening public lecture. There will also be junior researcher symposia interspersed within the conference and a special junior researcher networking reception. The conference will provide an ideal environment for advanced graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to explore the latest theoretical and experimental methods to investigate challenging questions in the physics of materials having tremendous importance to both fundamental science and technological applications. Members of underrepresented groups have been recruited as conference speakers to provide role models and potential mentors for the young scientists who will participate</AbstractNarration>
