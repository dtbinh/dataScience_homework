    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1219789&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Albert Marden, Anar Ahmadov, Tian-Jun Li&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2012 Yamabe Memorial Symposium will be held from Friday through Sunday noon, October 5-7, 2012, at the School of Mathematics, on the Minneapolis campus of the University of Minnesota. This year is the fiftieth anniversary of the Yamabe program. Each biennium, the geometry group of the School of Mathematics decides on a theme for the Symposium. The theme for this year is Geometric Analysis. The principal speakers will be Huaidong Cao, Lehigh University Jean-Pierre Demailly, Grenoble, France Benson Farb, University of Chicago Robert Hardt, Rice University Misha Kapovich, University of California, Davis Conan Leung, Chinese University of Hong Kong Natasa Sesum, Rutgers University Ben Weinkove, University of California, San Diego Together they represent a wide spectrum of the topic. As an essential complement to the talks, the participants will have considerable opportunity to have discussions with the speakers and with each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematicians today make extensive use of the internet to explore previous work, and especially to communicate quickly and easily with collaborators. Yet in spite of this internet dependence, in fact because of it, attendance at symposia and conferences is a regular occurrence in the life of a productive mathematician. It helps in keeping abreast of the "larger picture" of what is going on, what new discoveries are being made, and what new avenues are being explored. It helps to cement collaborations, friendships, and establish new mathematical contacts. Private discussions often inspire new ideas, new roads to follow, and new collaborations, Human to human contact is as essential among mathematicians as it is in human activity at large. The National Science Foundation is the principal funder of such symposia and conferences which encompass the great breadth of the mathematical community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details of the Yamabe Symposium are at www.math.umn.edu/yamabe.</AbstractNarration>
