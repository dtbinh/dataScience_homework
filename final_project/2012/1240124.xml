    <AbstractNarration>This California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) Noyce Teacher Scholars: Building Upon a Learning Assistant Model project encourages highly qualified mathematics and science students to pursue teaching careers through the collaborative efforts of CSUSM School of Education and College of Science and Mathematics. The program focuses on recruiting 38 CSUSM mathematics and science undergraduates to the CSUSM credential program and building on efforts to promote careers in teaching via an existing Learning Assistants Program (LAP). The project includes three specific activities: a scholarship program, early teaching experiences, and a STEM Summer Credential Program. There are existing partnerships and funded activities, including efforts to expand the LAP to nearby Palomar Community College, all of which support the recruiting efforts. Local K-12 school districts and professional development organizations support internships and induction for credential candidates and new teachers. The project employs proven approaches and leverages existing activities and partnerships, while building on model programs implemented at CSUSM by the PIs. Understanding the ways the LAP model can serve as a fulcrum for enhanced STEM teacher recruitment and how students come to decide whether to pursue a career in teaching are valuable outcomes for the STEM teacher preparation knowledge base.</AbstractNarration>
