    <AbstractNarration>The Departments of Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering as well as the National Center for Security Research and Training, and the Office of Strategic Initiatives at Louisiana State University jointly aim to increase the educational and pedagogical opportunities for academically talented faculty in information assurance and security. The focus of this project is to increase the number of US citizens, including members of under-represented groups, who will advance their teaching and research in the emerging areas of information assurance and security. Six Faculty/Student Scholar pairs are participating in a two-year training program. The training program is a series of development activities that include summer workshops, national lab/research center visits, and academic year mini-grants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholars explore open scientific problems in the protection of mission-critical information infrastructures including wide-area network threat detection and reasoning about complex events using model-based approaches to vulnerability analysis. Scholars also develop training and pedagogical materials for use at their home institutions. Distinguished scholars from national and homeland security laboratories work in collaboration with the LSU National Center for Security Research and Training to encourage research in information assurance and security and to extend the community of scholars.</AbstractNarration>
