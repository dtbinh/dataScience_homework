    <AbstractNarration>Bacteria that are exposed to a stressful environment are often better protected when they are then exposed to a second stressor. Understanding of this behavior, which is also known as cross-stress protection, is limited especially when it comes to its genetic basis. This project will characterize the genetic basis and evolutionary potential of cross-stress behavior in the bacterium Escherichia coli. To elucidate the evolutionary potential of bacteria and the emergence of cross-stress protection, E. coli will be exposed to three stressors, and organisms will be identified in which evolution under a first stress has conferred a fitness advantage (or disadvantage) upon exposure to a second stress. DNA sequencing will be used to identify genetic changes whose phenotypic effects will be validated by reversing the mutations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will generate new knowledge relevant to our understanding of microbial behavior in the agricultural and biotechnology sectors. The PI will host and train high school students in microbial evolution and bioinformatics through the UC Davis Biotechnology program. The PI will advise the UC Davis IGEM team in projects that include topics in microbial evolution and microbial stress response.</AbstractNarration>
