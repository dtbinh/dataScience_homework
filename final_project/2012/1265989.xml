    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this project is to investigate how construction projects can be made more resilient to delays in support of achieving on-time performance. Current scheduling paradoxically generates a sequence of activities that are most vulnerable to delays; the critical path. This research takes the opposite stance, that no schedule activity should be critical. Therefore fair allocation of limited time flexibility, called float, should be proportionate to the risk of individual subcontractors who perform critical activities. Conceptual analogies from several decision-making areas are explored as building blocks toward solving this allocation problem. For example, political voting addresses how to equalize the power of subcontractors that impact project outcomes; fair division focuses on allocating limited valuable assets such as float; game theory models address cooperation for win-win scenarios of allocating time flexibility; and agency theory describes incentives in hierarchical interactions within construction projects. Validating the method inspired by these analogies will entail simulations of exemplar and real schedules to compare scenarios without versus with the strategically allocated float in terms of mitigating delays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will improve risk mitigation by proactively protecting projects against critical delays, thereby reducing conflicts and claims, by solving the ambiguous issue of float ownership with mathematical fairness, and by treating float as a commodity. Ultimately, this allows the monetization and trading of float among subcontractors, which could incentivize on-time performance. Educational outreach activities focus on minority high school students in an inner-city career mentoring program, for whom a German-style board game on risk management will be created. Youth participating in on-campus summer programs will receive a discovery brochure with information and activities on project planning. Results will be widely distributed via industry case studies and a seminar to the community of professional schedulers.</AbstractNarration>
