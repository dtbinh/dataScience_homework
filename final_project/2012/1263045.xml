    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Vanderbilt University Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), program, which offers undergraduate physics and astronomy students the opportunity to work closely with faculty on forefront research projects in a variety of subfields of physics. The areas include astronomy, biological physics, condensed matter physics including nanoscience, laser physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. The extensive research infrastructure, including the facilities of several large interdisciplinary centers, will be available to the students. The Astronomy students will have opportunity for collaborative international research: they will take data and participate in exoplanets research with mentors at the South African Astronomical Observatory and at the Astrophysics Research Centre at Queen's University Belfast. They may also take data at the SMARTS facilities in Cerro Tololo, Chile. Physics students will have the opportunity to visit major facilities at government laboratories, both domestic and international, including FermiLab, Brookhaven, Oak Ridge, and CERN. The program is designed to build community among the students and the participating faculty as well as expose the students broadly to many areas of forefront physics and astronomy. Students are also offered the opportunity for training in the integration of research with education through the Fisk-Vanderbilt Physics &amp; Astronomy Roadshow outreach program. The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program and by the Office of International Science and Engineering within NSF.</AbstractNarration>
