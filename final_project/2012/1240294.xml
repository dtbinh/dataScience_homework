    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant seeks to explore how engineering fluid dynamics can be taught by engaging students from the arts on engineering teams. The study explore development of students' perception of fluid mechanics, contrasting what is learned with more traditional, mathematical approaches via the impact on learning outcomes and retention. A mixed-methods study and perceptual training study will be conducted to explore expertise development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arises through the potential for such alternative pedagogies to address both motivation and retention of students who are currently retained in engineering at a lower rate than peers. Combining students from visual arts and engineering backgrounds to explore fluid problems may lead to insights on communicating engineering to a broader audience. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by building the capacity of the nation's citizenry for addressing societal challenges through engineering.</AbstractNarration>
