    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to provide secure and robust communications in underwater sensor networks (UWSNs). Specifically, the project is investigating denial of service attacks and their countermeasures in such networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been a growing interest in developing underwater acoustic sensor networks in recent years, aiming for breakthroughs in aquatic environment monitoring for scientific exploration, commercial exploitation and coastline protection. The unique properties of underwater environments result in two major differences between UWSNs and land-based sensor networks: the communication method and sensor node mobility. Because radio frequency (RF) signals attenuate quickly in water, communications in UWSNs normally use acoustic channels, which feature long latencies, low bandwidth, high error rates, and high energy consumption. The mobility of sensor nodes leads to dynamic network topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since underwater sensor nodes are deployed in the field and communicate through acoustic channels that can be accessed easily by adversaries, they are vulnerable to various attacks. This project investigates denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and countermeasures in underwater networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three research thrusts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. DoS attacks and countermeasures at the physical and link layers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. DoS attacks and countermeasures at the network layer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. System integration and field testings. The outcomes of the project, including both attacks and countermeasures, will be thoroughly evaluated in simulation, lake, and ocean testbeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will lead to more robust communications in underwater networks, and thus advance the development and use of such networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the research significance, this project impacts education on three fronts. First, it will support graduate students in their advanced research in the fields of security, communication, networking, and computer engineering. Second, it will motivate undergraduates, especially women and other under-represented groups, to participate in advanced research in computing and engineering. Third, this project will promote multi-disciplinary collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
