    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide participant support for early career scientists and graduate students to participate in the "Centenary Symposium 2012: Discovery of Cosmic Rays" to be held on June 26-28, 2012 on the campus of the University of Denver, Denver, CO. 2012 will be the 100th anniversary of the discovery of highly penetrating radiation from outside the Earth by Viktor F. Hess in 1912. We now know this radiation as cosmic rays. This symposium will be held to celebrate this anniversary, to summarize the current status in this field, and to look forward to the new scientific questions to be asked and answered. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, it has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students. In addition, all sessions will be open to the interested public and there will be at least one evening session in which a public lecture with a title something like "The Origin of Cosmic Rays: A 100 Year Perspective" will be given by one of the participants.</AbstractNarration>
