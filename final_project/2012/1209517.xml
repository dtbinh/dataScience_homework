    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Qudus Hamid of Drexel University to conduct a research project, entitled "Fabrication of a microfluidic tissue array using a digital micro-mirroring device," during the summer of 2012 at Mechanical Engineering and Biomanufacturing Research Institute in Beijing, China. The host scientist is Professor Lin Feng.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the proposed research integrates fundamental photolithography, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems, bio-chemical sciences, engineering sciences, and enabling nano-micro freeform fabrication technologies with applications in life sciences, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. The proposed research incorporates microfabrication and Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) technologies to develop a micro tissue array with precise spatial control of biologics within the microchannels. The integration of these two technologies will be of great benefit to emerging tissue engineering and biotechnological applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
