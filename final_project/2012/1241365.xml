    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the National Academy of Sciences? Government University Industry Research Roundtable to support activities of the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP), an ongoing cooperative initiative among university research administrators, faculty and federal agency representatives. FDP, which currently consists of representatives from 119 academic institutions, 10 federal agencies and seven professional societies, offers a forum for members to improve the national research enterprise by its efforts to streamline and standardize research administration policies and procedures. During the current phase, FDP will develop and expand upon targeted demonstrations that address and provide guidance for several activities such as: modifying regulations involving effort reporting that correspond with the Office of Management and Budget circulars, developing a government-wide professional profile, identifying opportunities to share administrative infrastructure among categories of research institutions, and continuing efforts to reduce faculty time utilized on research-related administration. The organization continues to improve the relationship between federal agencies and the research community, ensuring the efficiency and integrity of STEM administration.</AbstractNarration>
