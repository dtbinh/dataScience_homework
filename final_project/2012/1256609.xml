    <AbstractNarration>The innovation uses custom hardware and software for accurate sleep classification in a cost-effective and durable design, as well as mobile "apps" to achieve memory enhancement by modulated consolidation (memC). By utilizing computer learning algorithms and models of the biological process underlying sleep, the innovation reduces the complexity of comparable systems. The system is tightly integrated with cloud systems to improve system performance for memory enhancement and reduce user experience complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the work is to develop tools and methods to optimize learning for students and adults of all ages. Particularly of interest is to provide a new approach for K-12 students diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Sheepdog Sciences is developing a commercial system to be used by students during study times and during sleep. By monitoring sleep and delivering the appropriate interventions, students using the device will improve the efficiency of sleep and study.</AbstractNarration>
