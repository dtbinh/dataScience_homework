    <AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research project considers the impact on spatial thinking skills of the increased use of digitally-based maps compared with the use of more traditional paper maps in geographic education. The ability to think in spatial terms is essential to the understanding of natural and cultural phenomena. Critical business, emergency preparedness, intelligence, and international relations decisions, among others, depend on spatial thinking. Spatial thinking skills allow people to recognize and understand relationships in multiple ways and to remember them in both static and dynamic representations. This project compares the use of digitally presented maps with traditional paper maps and considers how they impact the development of spatial thinking skills in K-12 students. Despite repeated suggestions that geographic information systems and virtual globes are unmatched for their ability to engage K-12 students in higher-level spatial thinking skills, there is little empirical evidence to suggest that paper maps, or other traditional low-tech instructional delivery, fare worse. This research is motivated by 1) a lack of student proficiency in geography content and skills in the United States; 2) inattention to the educational uses of digital maps; and 3) the overwhelming need to improve spatial thinking skills among K-12 students. Two research questions are posed: 1) Does spatial thinking skill development differ between paper and digital map instructional delivery? 2) Does spatial thinking skill development differ based on attitudes toward geography, past travel experience, or demographic variables such as gender, and are there interaction effects among them related to the instructional method? This project uses two curriculum components: South Carolina Maps and Aerial Photographic Systems, standards-based interdisciplinary middle school curriculum designed to enhance spatial thinking skills, and Google Earth, a frequently updated computer application that provides opportunities to see the Earth's varied geography from scales that range from global to street-level views. Participating teachers will be trained in both curricula and students will complete a basic questionnaire and attitudinal survey. Spatial thinking skill development will be measured as students participate in either paper-based or digital map-based instruction. Spatial thinking skills will be tested pre- and post-lesson implementation via the Spatial Thinking Ability Test. The research questions are investigated using a quasi-experimental (non-random) design involving classes of 8th grade middle school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study will advance K-12 learning by investigating the methods, traditional paper versus digital technology, best suited for delivering content that improves spatial thinking skills. This research project is designed to anticipate technology changes and challenges facing teachers in the future and to provide guidance on the best instructional delivery methods necessary to promote effective learning. This research furthers our understanding of how best to approach and foster these skills with students and ultimately create curriculum and materials to achieve those goals. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.</AbstractNarration>
