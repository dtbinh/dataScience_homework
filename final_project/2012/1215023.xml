    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a low-cost nanostructured smart window coating that reduces building energy consumption by dynamically optimizing solar gain. Scalable solution processed techniques will be used to create unique nanostructured electrochromic layers. The novel electrochromic layers will be initially examined for compatibility and performance then subsequently used to construct solid state energy efficient windows. Systematic characterization of the solid state electrochromic device will identify components in the system which are performance limiting. Upon successful fabrication, the electrochromic windows expect to achieve enhanced solar modulation at fast switching speeds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project pertains to residential and commercial buildings, representing a prime opportunity to improve energy efficiency and sustainability worldwide. Currently, lighting and thermal management within buildings accounts for 20% of domestic energy consumption. The economic and environmental benefits of using electrochromic windows are clear: reducing one quad (one quadrillion BTUs) of energy use would yield an average savings of $10.6 billion, while eliminating the need for about 21.5 gigawatts of power produced by fossil fuels, and saving nearly 59 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. It is estimated that the use of electrochromic windows in building can achieve a 50% reduction in peak energy demand and a 30% reduction in overall energy use. Still, current electrochromic windows in the market have not reached their market potential due to their high cost. The novel electrochromic windows in this project are based on an innovative design that increases lifetime and performance while reducing production cost. Wide scale adoption of this unique technology will not only enhance market penetration for dynamic windows, but will establish a new benchmark for performance and cost.</AbstractNarration>
