    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Paul Taele of Texas A&amp;M University to conduct a research project, entitled "Enhancing natural user interaction for air-based sketching," during the summer of 2012 at the NTU Mobile, Social, and HCI Research Lab in National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan. The host scientist is Dr. Mike Y. Chen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to investigate the types of gesture and sketch interactions that humans make with their hands and arms in the air, and to use that gained knowledge for enhancing natural user interfaces which exploit those types of interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
