    <AbstractNarration>Much of the biodiversity of flowering plants is due to their coevolutionary relationships with animal pollinators. Each species of pollinator is attracted to a particular flower because of the flower's color, size, shape, nectar reward, or scent. Little is known about the role of specific genes that cause changes in scent that then affect pollinator behavior. The genus Mimulus (monkeyflowers) contains two species that are separated only by the preferences of their pollinators (hummingbirds and bumblebees). The two Mimulus species have marked differences in their floral scents. This proposal focuses on two questions: 1) What are the genes that underlie these scent differences in Mimulus?; and, 2) How will plants that differ in these genetic traits affect the response of hummingbird and bumblebee pollinators in nature? The work proposed here addresses broader evolutionary principles that underlie species diversity. Additionally, since insect pollination is responsible for $225 billion per year in service to agriculture, understanding the genetic and evolutionary basis of plant-pollinator interactions has important implications for food security.</AbstractNarration>
