    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to transform the observed 2-3 orders-of-magnitude enhancement of two-photon absorption (2PA) in direct bandgap semiconductors using extremely non-degenerate (END) frequencies into photonics device technologies. In the proposed research, radically new device ideas for optical detection and switching will be explored that are made possible by this new discovery. This research is transformative in that the enhanced 2PA results in improved performance, and the types of devices made possible are new and unique. END 2PA greatly decreases the required irradiances needed for such devices. The combination of huge enhancements in 2PA and nonlinear refraction opens up a new realm of possibilities for photonic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The intellectual merit is that using END nonlinearities for photonic device applications allows a large reduction in the irradiances needed for nonlinear optical devices. This opens up a new realm of 2PA-based devices as well as great potential for improvement on existing 2-photon based devices. This research will help determine the ultimate limits for these types of nonlinear photonic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broader impacts are, besides funding the training of two Ph.D. students who will benefit from the rigorous graduate curriculum in Optics and Photonics at CREOL, that the large increase in nonlinear response enabled by END configurations has the potential to impact several fields beyond nonlinear optics, including detection and imaging, telecommunications and semiconductor lasers. The PIs also aim to increase the number of students from under-represented groups making use of the many connections and programs offered by our university.</AbstractNarration>
