    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte to develop a computational workflow&lt;br/&gt;that will create libraries of high-quality mass spectra for unknown metabolites that are observed&lt;br/&gt;repeatedly by mass spectrometers in metabolomics studies. Metabolomics is a rapidly developing field of&lt;br/&gt;?omics? research concerned with the high-throughput identification and quantitation of small molecule&lt;br/&gt;metabolites in the metabolome. Since the metabolome constitutes a wide array of compound classes that&lt;br/&gt;are crucial for the normal functioning of a biological system, the metabolomics approach promises to offer&lt;br/&gt;new insights in many areas of biological investigation. Recent metabolomics research benefited greatly&lt;br/&gt;from advances in mass spectrometry and chromatography. These advances allow researchers to detect&lt;br/&gt;many metabolites that could not be detected previously. However, a sizable fraction of these compounds&lt;br/&gt;are unknown and a new computational infrastructure is required for processing the complex mass&lt;br/&gt;spectral data and identifying and characterizing these metabolites. This project addresses this need by&lt;br/&gt;developing a computational workflow that will create libraries of high-quality mass spectra for unknown&lt;br/&gt;compounds from many samples. These resulting libraries will enable the identification of many currently&lt;br/&gt;unidentified, but commonly observed components by their spectra. Equally important, the workflow will&lt;br/&gt;allow more precise quantitation of metabolites and subsequent differential analysis of metabolic profiles.&lt;br/&gt;The most biologically interesting unknown compounds in the library can then be subjected to further&lt;br/&gt;attempts at structure elucidation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to the training of postdoctoral fellows and graduate students in bioinformatics&lt;br/&gt;methods. The PI will develop modules covering metabolomics bioinformatics methods for a graduate&lt;br/&gt;course. Materials developed for the class will also be made available online and presented at a&lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics workshop hosted at UNC-Charlotte.</AbstractNarration>
