    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor W. Carl Lineberger of the University of Colorado, together with his postdoctoral and graduate student researchers, will study the transient structures and reactive processes involving reaction intermediates and solvated anions. The experimental techniques include time-resolved photodissociation and photoelectron imaging spectroscopy and negative-ion photoelectron spectroscopy. Important classes of molecular systems that will be investigated include three-member cyclic carbon-nitrogen radicals important in combustion, the OO-OH radical important in determining the atmospheric concentration of OH near the tropopause, and a variety of ion-neutral complexes important in understanding proton transfer. A key component of all of the proposed experiments is the extensive participation of theoretical collaborators that brings state of the art theory, simulation, and experiment together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the systems to be investigated have been chosen for their fundamental science implications, they often have important medium-term applications, in fields ranging from atmospheric chemistry to combustion science to anionic polymerization. This project will also be a vehicle for scientific workforce development by providing students and postdoctoral researchers with a solid foundation across many areas of chemistry. In addition, participants in this research program will make important contributions to the extension of the Colorado Science Education Initiative (SEI) to undergraduate physical chemistry classes at Colorado. Finally, both the research and educational activities described in this proposal provide an essential credibility for the principal investigator in his continuing activities that involve advocacy of research and education for the physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
