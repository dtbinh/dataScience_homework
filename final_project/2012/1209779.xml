    <AbstractNarration>This project will consider the effects of reproductive behaviors, such as egg production and parental care, on survival and future reproduction. Reproducing females face a trade-off because current reproductive efforts can reduce survival and hence future reproductive output. Using an invertebrate model (Arizona bark scorpions), the investigators will use behavioral and physiological studies to understand the adverse effects of current reproduction on female survival and future reproduction. They expect to find that female Arizona bark scorpions will act in ways that enhance the health of their offspring regardless of any negative impacts on their own survival. This investigation addresses a basic question in animal life histories and reproductive behavior. The findings of this project will be applicable to a wide range of scientific fields, including animal behavior, reproductive biology, physiology, evolutionary biology . This study also provides opportunities to train undergraduate students in field biology. These students often include members of groups traditionally underrepresented in science. The investigators will produce a television episode about their research and give talks at elementary, middle, and high schools. These outreach activities will expose young students to animal biology and scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
