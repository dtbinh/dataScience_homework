    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will provide partial travel support for graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty members from the US to attend the Conference on the Geophysics of Slab Dynamics to be held in the Jeju Island, South Korea, from August 19 to August 22nd, 2012. All participants receiving support are required to present a talk or a poster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference is aimed to provide a holistic examination of subduction processes by discussing megathrust earthquakes and tsunami modeling, subduction dynamics and mantle convection, fluids in subduction systems, rheology and slab dynamics, seismic imaging of subducting slabs and induced mantle flow, and subduction and tectonics. The program includes a field trip aimed to provide a brief introduction of the Jeju Island geology. The Jeju island is a volcanic island recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its spectacular lava tubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will contribute to the development of the emerging scientists of the field by providing them with the opportunity to meet and interact with leading national and international researchers, gaining deeper understanding and broader perspective of the field, and forming the basis for future collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
