    <AbstractNarration>A number of research and education projects are working to bring real data into biology classrooms to build active, inquiry-driven learning opportunities so that students can discover patterns on their own through exploration, analysis and synthesis. This RCN-UBE project will bring together two communities critical in expanding student access to authentic science experiences: managers of data repositories and education specialists. Representatives from at least 15 organizations will participate in a two-day workshop to discuss strategies for enhancing data discovery and usability, to propose standards for data sharing, and to make recommendations for incorporating authentic data in inquiry-based teaching in biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed meeting will bring together education and technical leaders from participating projects to 1) explore opportunities and solutions for integrated data-sharing and accessibility solutions among projects, and 2) explore common education and outreach goals to maximize the impact of each project through collaboration. Participating projects represent leaders in biological database management, structure, and sharing, and leaders in promoting authentic scientific exploration opportunities in undergraduate biology classrooms. At the proposed meeting these groups will tackle the following specific questions. 1) What challenges are associated with data sharing across biological databases? 2) What are potential and practical solutions to enable data sharing across databases? 3) How can datasets be enhanced to facilitate their discovery and usability in educational contexts? 4) How can education organizations best share practices and experiences to enable authentic inquiry and enhance their effectiveness?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed meeting will bring together communities critical to enhancing the accessibility and use of real data in undergraduate biology education. At the conclusion of this meeting a set of recommendations will be published online for community feedback, then compiled as a published resource for data management and education communities. Other outcomes include a coordinated network to continue exploring solutions for improved accessibility of real data in education, data sharing across organizations, further publications reflecting resolutions reached by participants, and research on automated solutions for sharing data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts towards support of Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>
