    <AbstractNarration>When dealing with massive quantities of data, ranking and aggregate&lt;br/&gt;queries are powerful techniques for focusing attention on the most&lt;br/&gt;important answers. Many applications that produce such massive&lt;br/&gt;quantities of data inherently introduce uncertainty in the same time,&lt;br/&gt;for example, probabilistic match in data integration, imprecise&lt;br/&gt;measurements from sensors, fuzzy duplicates in data cleaning,&lt;br/&gt;inconsistency in scientific data. Hence, the importance of these&lt;br/&gt;queries is even greater in probabilistic data, where a relation can&lt;br/&gt;encode exponentially many possible worlds. Uncertainty opens the gate&lt;br/&gt;to many possible definitions for ranking and aggregate queries. This&lt;br/&gt;project systematically examines the underlying properties associated&lt;br/&gt;with the rich semantics of ranking and aggregate queries for large&lt;br/&gt;amounts of probabilistic data. More importantly, this project&lt;br/&gt;investigates the issue of how to design novel and scalable algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for processing these queries efficiently in various settings, such as&lt;br/&gt;the offline, centralized environment, distributed systems and the&lt;br/&gt;streaming model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the emergence of probabilistic data in many important application&lt;br/&gt;domains, the demand for understanding and processing the ranking and&lt;br/&gt;aggregate queries efficiently from the scientific community and beyond&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., government and military agencies) is expected to intensify in&lt;br/&gt;the coming years. The results of this project lay down a firm&lt;br/&gt;foundation for this important problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information, such as publications, data sets and source code, &lt;br/&gt;please see the project website at http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~lifeifei/rankaggprob</AbstractNarration>
