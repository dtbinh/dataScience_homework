    <AbstractNarration>Support is provided to support six two-year college faculty, who lead ATE Centers, to participate in the National Transportation Workforce Development Summit in April, 2012 and in the meeting of the Council of University Transportation Centers (CUTC) in June, 2012 and to support three leaders of University Transportation Centers (UTC) to participate in the ATE PI meeting in October, 2012. The purpose is to close gaps between 2- and 4-year institutions in the nation?s career pathways for developing the future transportation workforce. Two-year college participants learn about the emerging transportation technologies and workforce needs that can influence the development of new technical programs. Members of the UTC learn how ATE centers work closely with industry to support nationwide reform of technician education. Together both groups can influence the policies needed to support career pathways in transportation.</AbstractNarration>
