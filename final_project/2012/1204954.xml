    <AbstractNarration>This project led by Polk Community College is enhancing an existing Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Technology program and converting it to an Open Entry/Open Exit (OEOE) format. In the OEOE format, course objectives are divided into single credit hour units that can be scheduled to fit time constraints of students. The program addresses the needs of working students and provides a learner centric focus. Through outreach activities, student interest in advanced manufacturing and enrollment in the program is increased. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OEOE format is modeled on other successful programs but tailored to fit the local constraints within the Florida College System. NSF sponsored ATE Centers are partnered with Polk Community College to assist with the curriculum development efforts. The project is responsive to local industry needs and has industry involvement throughout the planning and implementation. Students can also be placed in industries to obtain practical experience and by collaborating with four year institutions; the project is enabling students to transfer to four year schools to continue their studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OEOE format and a partnership with the Polk County Public Schools enable secondary and college instructors to strengthen their knowledge of Advanced Manufacturing principles by completing selected units of study. This instructor development ensures a strong sustainable program.</AbstractNarration>
