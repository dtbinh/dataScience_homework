    <AbstractNarration>The goals of the BioTiER (Biological Training in Education and Research) Scholars S-STEM Program project at Cal Poly Pomona are to (1) increase recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority and financially disadvantaged students pursuing advanced degrees in the biological sciences, (2) increase graduation rates and decrease time to degree, and (3) offer career development opportunities so students adapt and excel once in the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit derives from the sector-specific training program along three career tracks offered in (1) STEM industries including biotechnology, environmental/green technology, biomedical engineering &amp; pharmaceutical, (2) academia &amp; faculty training, and (3) pursuit of other STEM fields requiring advanced degrees. This project is poised to create an educational network comprised of community colleges, companies in the STEM industries, and research universities with the Biological Sciences Department at Cal Poly Pomona serving as the central point of training and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts are realized by providing a better educated workforce entering the U.S. and California life sciences and engineering industries where demand for skilled workers with degrees beyond the Bachelor's level is growing. Further, this project provides high-quality life science educators available to institutions of higher learning, in particular community colleges. The activities created for the program are planned to become part of an already existing infrastructure, so that the novel benefits of the program will continue even after the end of the grant period. Plans are in place to share project findings, instructional materials, and best practices models with local and national entities with a similar purpose.</AbstractNarration>
