    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Benjamin D. Zinszer of Pennsylvania State University to conduct a research project, entitled "Special brain processes in bilinguals for categorizing objects and sounds," during the summer of 2012 at Beijing Normal University in Beijing, China. The host scientist is Professor Hua Shu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is a step towards the consolidation of first and second language learning as well as cross-language transfer under a unified developmental model. Differences in categorical representation of phonology and semantics have been widely observed between languages, necessitating a coherent explanation for the resolution of these conflicts in bilinguals. The results promise to benefit language educators with an improved understanding of the underlying challenges and learning processes that learners undergo throughout language learning. This study includes a diverse sample of participants, across ages and language histories in China, and provides an opportunity to extend this research to under-represented populations of Chinese-English bilinguals in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
