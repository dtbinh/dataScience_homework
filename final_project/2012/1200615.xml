    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for participants in a workshop on Geometric Analysis on Euclidean and Homogeneous Spaces at Tufts University, January 8-9, 2012. The workshop will encompass the related fields of integral geometry, harmonic analysis, differential geometry, representation theory, microlocal analysis and partial differential equations. These subjects find applications in areas as diverse as inverse problems, tomography, and signal and data analysis, all of which will be represented at the workshop. The workshop will be organized so that researchers and graduate students in the different fields will have ample opportunities to interact with the hope of developing collaborations. This range of fields is not typically represented together at workshops, and cross-fertilization between these fields is an important goal of the workshop. The workshop is preceded by the annual Joint Mathematics Meeting in Boston and uses the momentum of this national event to bring together well-known experts, young researchers, and graduate students. Women, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and young faculty will have the highest priority for support. The PIs plan to disseminate the research through proceedings that will include works by researchers from both the special session and the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interface between the topics of this conference has lead to fruitful research and applications to medicine, industry, and science in the past. This meeting will provide the opportunity to push this positive development forward by bringing together, engaging, and motivating graduate students and young emerging researchers as well as more established experts. In particular graduate students are involved in the workshop through participation in a poster session. This allows the students to present their work and interact with each other and established experts in an informal setting. Supporting a diverse group of graduate students and beginning researchers is the highest funding priority.</AbstractNarration>
