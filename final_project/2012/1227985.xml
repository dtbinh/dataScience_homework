    <AbstractNarration>Justice and rule-of-law measures have often been touted as a solution to prevent the resumption&lt;br/&gt;of violence following conflict; yet little work has been undertaken to understand the prevalence&lt;br/&gt;of these practices while conflict remains ongoing. These measures include trials, truth&lt;br/&gt;commissions, reparations, as well as alternative accountability processes such as amnesties,&lt;br/&gt;purges, and exiles. While existing research has focused on the implementation of justice&lt;br/&gt;processes once conflict has ended, pilot data by the PIs suggests that these same practices are&lt;br/&gt;often implemented during violence. The current state of the literature provides little theoretical&lt;br/&gt;understanding as to when and why during-conflict justice processes are implemented and their&lt;br/&gt;likely effect on the duration of conflict and durability of peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the implementation of during-conflict justice to understand which&lt;br/&gt;processes, if any, a government implements during internal armed conflicts and in which&lt;br/&gt;contexts such processes are pursued. Through the collection of a new cross-national dataset&lt;br/&gt;covering the implementation of justice measures during all civil wars since the Second World&lt;br/&gt;War, this research greatly improves our understanding of the presence of during-conflict justice&lt;br/&gt;and expands the current state of research on both the implementation of justice processes and the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of conflict more broadly. This project provides an evidentiary basis to determine the&lt;br/&gt;conditions under which implementation is more likely, to facilitate the development of these&lt;br/&gt;conditions in countries that may benefit from justice measures and to prevent the development of&lt;br/&gt;circumstances detracting from these goals. Furthermore, the results of this research will be used&lt;br/&gt;to understand the potential misuses of justice measures for goals not related to conflict resolution&lt;br/&gt;and promotion of the rule-of-law, leading to more effective conflict termination strategies and&lt;br/&gt;shortening the duration of civil conflict.</AbstractNarration>
