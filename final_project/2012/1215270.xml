    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a system&lt;br/&gt;for locating a smartphone inside a building very accurately, helping users&lt;br/&gt;navigate and find items of interest indoors, where current systems do not&lt;br/&gt;function. Building on academic research from MIT, the system will use&lt;br/&gt;existing Wi-Fi signals combined with motion sensors and map data to produce&lt;br/&gt;estimates with a 90th percentile accuracy of 1-3 m. This is significantly&lt;br/&gt;more accurate than the currently available systems, which are accurate to&lt;br/&gt;within 5-10 metres in the mean and worse in the 90th percentile. It uses&lt;br/&gt;existing Wi-Fi signals, which means the system does not require additional&lt;br/&gt;hardware in most buildings. The system incorporates three novel technologies:&lt;br/&gt;1) a novel training system that uses motion sensors and map data to&lt;br/&gt;dramatically reduce the time it takes to calibrate the system in a new&lt;br/&gt;building compared to existing technologies, 2) a new location matching&lt;br/&gt;algorithm that fuses motion sensors and WiFi signals to improve the accuracy&lt;br/&gt;and reliability of location estimates from limited training data, and 3) a&lt;br/&gt;system to predict the accuracy using the available Wi-Fi access points, to&lt;br/&gt;determine if new hardware or additional training is required. All three&lt;br/&gt;technologies are key competitive advantages essential to bring this&lt;br/&gt;technology to market. This proposal will develop a Wi-Fi-based indoor&lt;br/&gt;location system that is not only accurate, but also easy and cheap to deploy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that smartphones,&lt;br/&gt;that have become indispensable tools for locating buildings and businesses in a&lt;br/&gt;city, can now also be used to show a user his/her location on an indoor map,&lt;br/&gt;and guide them to find what they are looking for inside large buildings where&lt;br/&gt;people get lost all the time today --- while looking for points of interest&lt;br/&gt;like ticket counters, products on shelves, airline gates, and stores. InFix's&lt;br/&gt;approach of using existing WiFi beacons, ubiquitous everywhere today, has the&lt;br/&gt;highest potential to achieve scale and reach, and realize the vision of&lt;br/&gt;"precise location everywhere". This is in contrast to previous academic,&lt;br/&gt;research and commercial efforts that all require installing specialized&lt;br/&gt;hardware. Infix will license this technology to space owners, to integrate into&lt;br/&gt;their smartphone applications. As the map and location database grow, the&lt;br/&gt;company will allow third-parties to build their own innovative applications.</AbstractNarration>
