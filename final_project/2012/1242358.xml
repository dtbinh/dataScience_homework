    <AbstractNarration>The buildup of electric charges on the surface of materials is frequently large enough to cause electrostatic discharge (ESD). This is a serious problem in the semiconductor and the electronic industry because ESD causes product damage ranging from immediate failure to performance degradation and shortened lifetimes. In 2010 the electronic manufacturing industry spent approximately $950 MM in ESD prevention products. Currently electric field sensors are not capable of monitoring people and work areas for the buildup of the charge that leads to ESD. Therefore, industry focuses on ESD prevention without monitoring charge buildup. With funding from NSF, the team developed a sensor capable of measuring static electric fields vectors with high accuracy and sensitivity. The designed and fabricated two versions of the sensor, one version is simpler the other is more accurate. The sensor is being used in science and engineering applications. It has been demonstrated to potential industrial partners with positive results. Based on the feedback from these potential customers, the team proposes to refine the platform and determine the viability of both versions as commercial products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed charge sensor will enable electronic manufacturers to identify ESD hazards and to address potential problems at their sources, reducing expenses, and improving product quality and productivity. The sensor will also be useful in the electrostatic painting industry because the quality of applied paint depends on the electric fields generated by painting robots. Another industrial application is the prevention of ESD during the handling of flammables and explosives. Besides industrial applications, there are many scientific applications. For example, there is evidence that electric forces play an important role on the lifting of dust particles from the surface. This is an important process because dust aerosols play an important role on climate. If successfully deployed, the proposed sensor has the potential to address multiple opportunities in industry and research.</AbstractNarration>
