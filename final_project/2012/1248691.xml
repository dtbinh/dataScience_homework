    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project aims to develop a device to reliably and safely close laparoscopic port sites. Laparoscopy is becoming the gold standard for all abdominal procedures. Laparoscopy requires small incisions to be made in the abdominal wall to allow access to the abdominal cavity. These small incisions are extremely difficult and frustrating to close due to their size and the size of the patient. If a poor closure is attempted or these ports are not closed, the patient is placed at increased risk of developing life threatening complications. Surg Solutions proposes to develop a device to reliably and safely close these port sites in 30 seconds. The goals of this phase 1 project are to redesign an early-concept prototype for manufacturability, to perform bench testing and animal testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to reduce the specific complications associated with closing laparoscopic surgical incisions. One component of laparoscopic procedures that is often overlooked is the access sites. If not closed properly or left open, the patient is at increased risk for life threatening complications. These complications impact the patient and end up costing the health care system a significant amount of money from a treatment and litigation standpoint. Currently there are no good techniques or instruments available to close these port sites. If successful, this technology could become a preferred procedure for closing port sites with a market potential of $400 million. In addition, this device could potentially reduce the cost to the health care system and improve the quality of life of patients undergoing elective surgery.</AbstractNarration>
