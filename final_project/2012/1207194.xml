    <AbstractNarration>The PI will use gauged Floer theory to study non-displaceability of&lt;br/&gt;Lagrangian tori in possibly open symplectic manifolds via&lt;br/&gt;compactifications such as symplectic toric orbifolds, and compare with&lt;br/&gt;results of McDuff on displaceability. With F. Ziltener, his former&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral advisee E. Gonzalez, and his current student Sushmita&lt;br/&gt;Venugopalan the PI will study the quantum cohomology of quotients and&lt;br/&gt;relationships with gauged Gromov-Witten theory. In particular he will&lt;br/&gt;(a) prove a quantum version of Kalkman's wall-crossing formula which&lt;br/&gt;governs the behavior of Gromov-Witten invariants under variation of&lt;br/&gt;symplectic quotient and proves birational equivalence under crepant&lt;br/&gt;flops in many cases, as conjectured by Ruan (b) find presentations of&lt;br/&gt;quantum cohomology rings of symplectic quotients such as toric&lt;br/&gt;orbifolds and quiver varieties. With K. Wehrheim and his former&lt;br/&gt;student S. Ma'u the PI will continue to study holomorphic quilts,&lt;br/&gt;functoriality of Lagrangian correspondences in Floer-Fukaya theory,&lt;br/&gt;and relationship with low-dimensional topology. In particular, the PI&lt;br/&gt;will prove the A-infinity version and the exact triangle for fibered&lt;br/&gt;Dehn twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research projects will improve our understanding of symplectic&lt;br/&gt;geometry, which is a mathematical framework for understanding&lt;br/&gt;classical mechanics, particularly for time-dependent energy functions.&lt;br/&gt;Many of these projects are related to the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;symplectic invariants under the operation of symplectic reduction in&lt;br/&gt;which the number of degrees of freedom of a system is reduced by using&lt;br/&gt;symmetry. These invariants also appear in the study of&lt;br/&gt;quantum-mechanical ``sigma models'' by physicists, who&lt;br/&gt;have made a number or predictions about their behavior under&lt;br/&gt;symplectic reduction, some of which will be verified and generalized&lt;br/&gt;as part of the project. The project on holomorphic quilts will have&lt;br/&gt;applications to our understanding of three- and four-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;spaces, especially invariants constructed using gauge theories which&lt;br/&gt;are conjectured (and in some cases known) to have symplectic&lt;br/&gt;interpretations. The PI will also continue his involvement with middle&lt;br/&gt;school mathematics teachers.</AbstractNarration>
