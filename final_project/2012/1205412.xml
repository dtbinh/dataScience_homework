    <AbstractNarration>This project aims to address a persistent question in our understanding of atomic nuclei. The nature of low-lying excitations, K=0+ bands in deformed nuclei remain enigmatic in the field. The effort focuses on the search for vibrational excitations in the Gadolinium isotopes. Measurements will be conducted at the University of Kentucky Accelerator Facility (UKY), and analysis will be performed at the Institute for Structure &amp; Nuclear Astrophysics (ISNAP) at the University of Notre Dame (ND) during the three summers of the duration of the grant period and at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse (UW-L) during the academic year. The UW-L group will set-up, run, and analyze a series of (n,n'gamma) experiments during this time. To prepare the students for this summer work, the UW-L Nuclear Science Group will concentrate on detector work and analysis during the academic year. The results will be broadly disseminated through publications and conference presentations by the PI and undergraduate researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary broader impact of this project is to promote teaching and learning, while extending scientific innovation and understanding. All aspects of this project will be completed in a collaborative environment with UW-L undergraduates. The project will support an undergraduate research program that has a mentoring plan based on teaching rigorous analytical principles and on engaging undergraduates in research as freshmen or sophomores. Early engagement provides students with adequate time to develop advanced skills and participate in multiple stages of research, from experimental design to dissemination at conferences and in publications. The UW-L Nuclear Group strives to quickly develop a sense of independence in the undergraduate researcher. The goal is to continue to do relevant, potentially transformative science that is valued by the scientific community as a whole and simultaneously to transform the students from passive classroom learners to active researchers as they take responsibility for their particular research. This is accomplished by having regular group meetings and frequent individual planning meetings but then allowing the students to work independently with modern instrumentation. As a result, they learn planning, running experiments, analysis, modeling, and communication skills. Experience shows that undergraduate research enhances a student's education and better prepares the student for graduate work or for a wide variety of science careers in either industry or academia.</AbstractNarration>
