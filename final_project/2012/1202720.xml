    <AbstractNarration>Brain Connectivity During Human Locomotion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While walking is an activity most people do every day, how the brain functions during this movement remains an open scientific question. The project goal is to determine what brain areas are active, what roles they play, and how they interact throughout specific walking and walking-like behaviors. To accomplish this, electrocortical simulations will be used to determine what specific aspects of interaction are captured by a variety of functional connectivity measures. Next, independent component analysis will identify neurological sources from EEG data recorded during standing and walking in healthy and Parkinson's subjects, and in healthy subjects performing a simplified version of walking. Finally, functional connectivity will be measured between EEG signals and electrocortical sources in brain regions such as the anterior cingulate and the left and right sensorimotor cortices during these conditions to determine how the brain functions move the body in a changing environment.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research will provide the fellow with experience in computational neuroscience. The project's results may benefit compromised populations by improving rehabilitation practices, such as in analysis and treatment of movement disorders. Understanding brain function in individuals with Parkinson's or spinal cord injury, could potentially lead to assistive devices that restore motor function. Further, this project will aim to increase the number of women involved in science by mentoring undergraduates and by putting on a camp for young girls that uses hands-on labs to show how neuroscience and math can explain simple everyday movements.</AbstractNarration>
