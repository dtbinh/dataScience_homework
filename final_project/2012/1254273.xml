    <AbstractNarration>CAREER Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Low Temperature Microplasmas For Thermal Energy Conversion, Education, and Outreach&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thermionic energy conversion (TEC) is the direct conversion of heat to electricity by the thermal&lt;br/&gt;(thermionic) emission of electrons from a very hot surface. Though historically pursued primarily&lt;br/&gt;for electricity production from nuclear sources in space applications, it has the potential to be used&lt;br/&gt;terrestrially for waste heat, solar, or nuclear energy conversion. To meet this objective, however,&lt;br/&gt;TEC must be enhanced to operate more efficiently at lower temperatures than historically possible.&lt;br/&gt;Microplasma thermionic energy conversion occurs when a microplasma (ionized gas) is ignited&lt;br/&gt;between a thermionic diode with an electrode spacing ~1-20 micrometers. This mode of operation&lt;br/&gt;could enable operation in inert gases, at near atmospheric pressures, and at lower temperatures - all&lt;br/&gt;necessary features for practical terrestrial application. Understanding of the fundamental interaction&lt;br/&gt;between thermionic emission and microplasmas will be advanced by this research in order to pave&lt;br/&gt;the way for microplasma-TEC devices. First principles theory and simulations will be used to reveal&lt;br/&gt;the inter-dependence between a microplasma and thermionic emission, and experiments will be&lt;br/&gt;conducted to confirm the enhancement of thermionic emission by a microplasma necessary to realize&lt;br/&gt;improved energy conversion efficiency. Carbon-based electrodes, including diamond and carbon&lt;br/&gt;nanotubes, will be synthesized using a microplasma jet processing technique and used as electrodes&lt;br/&gt;in microplasma-TEC experiments. In addition to the efficacy of microplasma-TEC being established&lt;br/&gt;by this research, fundamental studies will also advance the basic understanding of plasma/electrode&lt;br/&gt;coupling, where there are persistent questions that affect a wide variety of technologies from highintensity&lt;br/&gt;discharge lamps to arc-based materials deposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Direct thermal-to-electrical energy conversion can be used to convert solar, nuclear, and waste heat&lt;br/&gt;to electricity, and energy conversion technologies will play an important role in creating a more&lt;br/&gt;energy efficient and independent nation. The discoveries made by this research will lay the&lt;br/&gt;foundation for practical, terrestrial TEC devices that could become an essential part of the energy&lt;br/&gt;economy, greatly impacting energy security in the United States. Further, undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;from underrepresented minorities will be engaged in this research early in their careers, creating a&lt;br/&gt;more effective undergraduate research experience and increasing the number that achieve graduate&lt;br/&gt;science and engineering degrees. Using a service-learning approach, outreach to the local K-8 youth&lt;br/&gt;in the community will be led by these undergraduates including the creation of a plasma exhibit for a&lt;br/&gt;community-wide science festival and a targeted, interactive outreach program on environmental&lt;br/&gt;science for middle school students. These undergraduate students will be exposed to the fulfilling&lt;br/&gt;nature of outreach and also inspire a large number of K-8 youth toward science and engineering,&lt;br/&gt;creating a perpetuating educational cycle in which each generation fosters the inspiration,&lt;br/&gt;excitement, and development of the next generation.</AbstractNarration>
