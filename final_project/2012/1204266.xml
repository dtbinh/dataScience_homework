    <AbstractNarration>The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region of the Southern Ocean is undergoing some of the most dramatic warming on the planet, leading to dramatic changes in ecosystem structure and function. Past research has indicated that these shifts are affecting the phytoplankton community, but little is known regarding how specific organisms are changing in abundance and activity. This research will develop a microarray tool to track changes in the presence and absence of different microbes as well as the activity of these organisms. This will lead to greater insight into the ecosystem processes that are currently affected by environmental change in the WAP, as well as a way to predict future shifts. Results will be widely disseminated through publications as well as through presentations at national and international meetings. In addition, raw data will be made available through open-access databases. This project will support the research and training of a post-doctoral fellow. As well, the microarray developed for this work will be made available to other research groups to facilitate a greater understanding of shifts in community structure in the Southern Ocean. Researchers on this project will participate in outreach programs targeting K12 teachers as well as high school students.</AbstractNarration>
