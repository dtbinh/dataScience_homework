    <AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program at the National Science Foundation supports the research of Professor Alexander Li and his group at Washington State University to develop new molecular tools for measuring forces between molecules. This research investigates the use of folded, yet stretchable oligomers/polymers as force sensors for revealing molecular forces that play important roles in biological systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of a molecular force sensor that can sense force applied over a defined distance (in nanometer scale) would provide a useful tool for studying chemical and biological systems and would advance our knowledge of structure and dynamics of self-assembled systems. This project provides interdisciplinary research training to students. Science workshops will be offered to arouse the interest of middle and high school students (including students from socio-economically disadvantaged families) in science.</AbstractNarration>
