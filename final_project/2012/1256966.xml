    <AbstractNarration>This is a study of historical study of a new form of listening that evolved in the twentieth century, threshold listening, which grew out of turn-of-the century field and laboratory studies in Europe and the United States on the physical and emotional effects of music. This study will explore how this new understanding of the bodily effects of listening despite inattention fueled the development of new consumer products and has come to be one of the main processes by which we navigate our daily environments. Research methods include archival research on internal memoranda, correspondence, and advertising development in the William Maxwell Files of the Edison Papers at the Edison National Historic Park and interviews with musicologists, composers, and recording company executives that were involved in the development of background music products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background music is a ubiquitous part of our lives that is, by design, given little attention by those who passively consume it. Yet, those who study, design and produce it understand the ways can affect people?s moods and behavior, for example, increasing work place efficiency or stimulating consumption. This research will provide new knowledge and understanding of the &lt;br/&gt;central role that science played in the development of background music and the ways in which music consumption and emotions are intertwined.</AbstractNarration>
