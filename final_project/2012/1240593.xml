    <AbstractNarration>This project will facilitate the collaboration of a group of scientists interested in delivery, transport and transformation of organic matter in a variety of surface waters. The group will synthesize data across spatial and temporal scales and bring together a multi-disciplinary team at the John Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and Synthesis. The effort will re-evaluate the fundamental relationships between discharge and DOM concentration and composition and focus on synthesizing mature datasets from small headwater basins to large coastal basins using statistical techniques and modeling. Data are available that represent a range of temporal sampling intensities from seasonal samples, to more frequent samples from automated samplers, and finally to data from continuous optical sensors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This synthesis collaboration is expected to advance scientific understanding of the processes and patterns of organic matter transport by exploring key data sets at a level of detail and scale that has not previously been attempted. The work is expected to also benefit the policy and management communities that rely on data, models, and understanding of the controls on nutrient, trace metal, and pollutant transport in river networks and to estuaries. This is a joint synthesis projects with the USGS Powell Center, Fort Collins Colorado.</AbstractNarration>
