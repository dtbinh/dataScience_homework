    <AbstractNarration>COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: ARCTIC DINOSAUR PALEOBIOLOGY: HYPOTHESIS TESTING THROUGH CROSS-LATITUDINAL COMPARISON &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principle Investigator: Patrick Druckenmiller, University of Alaska Fairbanks&lt;br/&gt;Co-Principle Investigator: Gregory M. Erickson, Florida State University, Tallahassee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polar dinosaurs endured intense seasonal conditions making them well suited to test major questions in dinosaur paleobiology pertaining to physiology, migration and distribution. This project will examine the most prolific, yet vastly understudied polar dinosaur fauna known, the Prince Creek Formation of northern Alaska. The research will entail collection, description, and assessment of species composition. These data will be compared to those of lower latitude formations affording the first comparison between a polar dinosaur fauna and typical lower latitude dinosaurian assemblages. The study will also document the influence of the Alaskan Arctic environment on dinosaur biology through analyses of bone and tooth growth rings. Learning how dinosaurs occupied the Arctic will provide new insights into high latitudinal occupation by animals as a whole. This project will bring together a diverse team of scientists who will share new ideas and methodologies and contribute to the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students. Results will be submitted to scientific journals and presented publicly on the Internet. Visits will be made to rural, northern Alaskan K-12 schools to provide underserved Alaska Native students and teachers with an opportunity to learn about the fossils in their area and interact with NSF-sponsored researchers.</AbstractNarration>
