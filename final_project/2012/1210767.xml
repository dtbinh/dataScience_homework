    <AbstractNarration>Temperature rise from anthropogenic climate change is often especially pronounced at high elevations, where it threatens the survival of many species. This project will study how the upper elevational boundary of trees at about 4000 m is responding to climate change in relatively pristine forests of the Nepal Himalayas. Preliminary work suggests that the upper elevational boundary of one of the dominant trees, a species of Rhododendron, is rapidly shifting upward, with individuals at the highest elevations being more tolerant to extreme climate conditions but less tolerant of competition than individuals only 150 m lower. This project will expand this work to include additional measures of differences between individuals and sites that differ in key characteristics such as aspect and rainfall. Results will help show how montane species respond to climate change, how responses may depend upon interactions between species or site specifics, and which mechanisms drive shifts in range at high elevation and determine associated risks of local extinction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will train students in field methods and provide them with an opportunity to explore natural areas distant from cities. Additionally, the project will form a new international collaboration between researchers at the University of Texas and Tribhuvan University and the Nepal Academy of Science and Technology in Nepal. The co-PI will teach short courses to undergraduate and graduate students in Kathmandu on current trends in ecology, climate change research, and advanced statistical tools. Outreach presentations to the general public will be given in Jumla and Kathmandu to increase their awareness of climate change and its impacts on their lives.</AbstractNarration>
