    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Amy Klegarth of the University of Notre Dame to conduct a research project, entitled "Genetic relationships and ranging patterns of urban monkeys," during the Summer of 2012 at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The host scientist is Dr. Michael Gumert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project includes the first effort to track long-tailed macaques with satellite collars and compare their population genetic structure on varied temporal and spatial scales. The multi-pronged approach is novel within the field and has broader implications for disease ecology and complements ongoing research examining the population genetic structure of gastrointestinal parasites harbored by the macaques. Modeling is being used to assess the impact of parasite transmission and provide powerful predictions for identifying potential transmission routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the research is being reported in a blog and the Fellow leads guided tours educating visitors about wildlife tracking. Research results are being presented to the National Parks Board (NPB) to encourage proactive protocols for dealing with human-macaque conflict and for identifying problem areas where education, outreach programs, and population control programs can focus on mitigating human-macaque conflict at their interface.</AbstractNarration>
