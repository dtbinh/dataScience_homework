    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Andrew Sykes from University of South Dakota and colleagues Paul May, Grigoriy Sereda and Ranjit Koodali will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with solid state capabilities equipped with a pulsed field gradient (PFG), high sensitivity liquid probe (for 1H, 13C, 19F, and 31P nuclei), a high resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) probe for liquid samples, variable temperature (VT) capability, and an automatic sample changer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) luminescent nanomaterials for biological and materials applications; (b) derivatization of quantum dots for drug delivery; (c) reactivity of frustrated Lewis pairs; (d) study of the mechanism of formation ofperiodic cubic mesoporous materials; (e) green chemistry using carbonaceous catalysts; (f) organic, nano-assemblies for photocatalytic water splitting; (g) fluorinated materials for air-stable and moisture-resistant flexible optoelectonics; (h) metal-organic chemistry of fluorescence sensors; and (i) thiacalixarene based metal-organic cages as artificial receptors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research at the University of South Dakota but also at South Dakota State University (SDSU) and South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&amp;T). The instrument will also be used extensively in the education and training of underserved groups, including students and faculty at tribal and small rural colleges through The Northern Plains REU Site: Serving the Needs of Regional Tribal Colleges and Primary Undergraduate Institutions.</AbstractNarration>
