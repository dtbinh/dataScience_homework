    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for research enabling the development of a fully three-dimensional multiphysics phase-field model and related experimentation for understanding of the electrohydrodynamic process of needleless electrospinning. Needleless electrospinning, based on free liquid-surface jetting, is a novel low-cost, top-down nanomanufacturing technique capable of continuous, scalable production of nanofibers of natural and synthetic polymers and polymer-derived carbon, ceramics, semiconductors, metals, metal oxides, etc. for broad applications in filtration, biomedical engineering, energy conversion and storage, nanocomposites, and so on. The developed computational model formulates a generalized free energy of an electrospinning system that is capable of uniformly treating the multiphysics, multiphase phenomenon of the process including multi-jet initiation, jet stretching, phase separation, drying, etc. The developed phase-field model can overcome the numerical difficulty in tracking the instantaneous profile of the liquid surface after multi-jetting and pore formation. Efficient semi-implicit spectral algorithm will be used for fast, robust numerical simulation. The model will determine several key parameters used in needleless electrospinning and be validated by controlled experimentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results will establish solid theoretical foundation for needleless electrospinning and the predictive computational model will generate a wealth of fundamental knowledge for design, optimization and control of needleless electrospinning and other electrohydrodynamics-related devices (e.g., electrospray) for reliable, efficient, mass production. The results will benefit the computer-aided electrospinning engineering (CAEE) in education, research and industrial applications. The research provides a variety of opportunities for graduates and undergraduates, specially unrepresented minorities including Native American students and female students, to involve in the cutting-edge nanotechnology and computational materials science. The research will be demonstrated to K-12 students and students in the regional Native American tribal colleges. The results will be used for updating the relevant undergraduate and graduate curriculum materials and the development of a new cross-listed course at North Dakota State University.</AbstractNarration>
