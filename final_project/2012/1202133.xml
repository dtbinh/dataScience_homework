    <AbstractNarration>Advanced Real-Time Battery Characterization and Management: Safe, Reliable, and Optimal Operation of Battery Systems for Electric-Drive Vehicles and Grid Support&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop new methods for real-time characterizing and adaptively managing battery systems to ensure their optimal and healthy operation, which is critical for accomplishing clean, efficient and sustainable energy development in transportation and power sectors. The research approach is: (1) Joint estimation of battery's State of Charge, State of Health, and model parameters; (2) adaptive battery management with optimal battery charging and cell balancing control; (3) integration and management of used electric vehicle batteries for grid energy storage via State of Charge weighted power control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits: (1) Fast, robust and accurate battery characterization via real-time and joint estimation for achieving adaptive and optimal battery management. (2) Facilitating the second use of retired electric vehicle batteries. (3) Versatile and transformative technologies for different types of batteries and model structures, and for new or old batteries. (4) Complementary educational tools and programs to enhance the educational effort in vehicle electrification and sustainable energy development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The success of this project will help achieve cleaner and more efficient transportation, along with more reliable power grids capable of integrating higher quantities of electricity from intermittent renewable sources. All these will eventually lead to a more secure and sustainable energy development in the U.S.A. This project will have significant educational, societal, and economical impacts by advancing technology and workforce development for the industry of electric-drive vehicle, battery, renewable energy and smart grid, which are all the critical areas for the nation's security and future development.</AbstractNarration>
