    <AbstractNarration>This action funds David Joseph Bodine of the University of Oklahoma to conduct a research project, entitled "Understanding the motion of debris and precipitation in tornadoes," during the summer of 2012 at Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan. The host scientist is Professor Takashi Maruyama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the use of a computer model to study how different debris and precipitation move in tornadoes, and how different types of tornado flows impact the concentration of debris and precipitation. The results from the computer model help explain dual-polarimetric radar signatures of precipitation and debris in tornadoes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
