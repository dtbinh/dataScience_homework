    <AbstractNarration>This MRI grant will help support the development of a particle detector being built by an international collaboration of scientists. The primary objective for the experiment using this detector is the search for new and exotic forms of matter. Regular matter is made from protons, neutrons and electrons. Many other types of particles are known, but some short-lived particles are predicted to exist from theoretical models of the theory of the strong force, called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). When high-energy photons strike a proton target, many particles are produced, and some of these may be the predicted exotic particles such as glueballs or hybrid mesons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the process of developing this instrumentation, physicists train students in the use of high-technology equipment and electronics. Some of these students go on to develop new uses of the technology, such as the diagnostic equipment used in many hospitals, including MRI, CAT and PET scanners. The economic impact of a highly-trained workforce is well-documented. The development of this equipment will train students with high technology skills that are needed in today's marketplace, while adding to our understanding of QCD.</AbstractNarration>
