    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Emanuel G. Indrei of The University of Texas at Austin to conduct a research project in mathematics, entitled "Investigating strategies that optimize the partial allocation of resources" during the summer of 2012 at Australian National University in Canberra ACT, Australia. The host scientist is Prof. Neil Trudinger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the investigation of free boundary regularity for the partial optimal transport problem. This problem is a generalization of the classical Monge-Kantorovich problem in which one tries to find a strategy of allocating a given number of resources as cheaply as possible. The research seeks an understanding of the regularity of this optimal strategy. The natural setting for this work is the field of partial differential equations and convex geometry, more specifically, the study of a double obstacle problem for the Monge-Amp√®re equation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
