    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;With the advances in the hardware technology and ever-decreasing cost of imaging circuitry, cameras have become&lt;br/&gt;ubiquitous in our lives. The large amounts of video data generated by multiple cameras necessitate automatic&lt;br/&gt;analysis of activities from video. With the introduction of smart cameras, it has now become viable to install&lt;br/&gt;many spatially-distributed cameras interconnected by wireless links. A smart camera is a stand-alone unit that&lt;br/&gt;not only captures images, but also includes a processor, memory and communication interface. This project&lt;br/&gt;takes a holistic view of the problems that need to be solved to build scalable, battery-powered wireless smart-&lt;br/&gt;camera networks (Wi-SCaNs). It focuses on providing a unifying solution to perform tasks distributively, and&lt;br/&gt;communicate in a P2P fashion over wireless links while making e±cient use of limited resources, such as energy&lt;br/&gt;and bandwidth. This research explicitly considers the challenges of wireless channels, and addresses the issues&lt;br/&gt;of scarce resources, P2P protocol design and channel usage priorities simultaneously. The expected outcomes of&lt;br/&gt;this project include light-weight vision algorithms that are portable to embedded smart cameras, characterization&lt;br/&gt;of the energy-bandwidth-delay tradeo®s in Wi-SCaNs, e±cient resource allocation strategies, and P2P wireless&lt;br/&gt;communication protocols that leverage the knowledge of the wireless channel conditions. The outcomes will have&lt;br/&gt;an important positive impact, because they will fundamentally advance the automatic activity analysis solutions&lt;br/&gt;by providing installation of any number of cameras anywhere, and will ¯nd wide-ranging applications including&lt;br/&gt;surveillance in military, commercial or public scenarios, elderly care and wildlife monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
