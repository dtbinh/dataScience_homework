    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the physics Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Michigan. Each year, the REU program will provide ten students from around the United States an opportunity to participate in a ten-week summer research program. REU students work closely with a faculty mentor on a ten-week research project. In addition, they are exposed to a variety of research topics and methodologies through a series of research seminars. To assist in their professional development, students also participate in tutorials on ethics, applying to graduate school, scientific writing and giving scientific presentations. At the end of the program, the students participate in a two-day REU symposium where they present their research results to their peers and faculty mentors. They also prepare written project reports that can lead to peer reviewed publications. Research work is augmented by an extensive array of educational and social activities, including safety training, machine shop and electronic shop classes, lab tours, research seminars given by faculty, and a variety of lunches with other students and faculty. These activities allow students to put their research experience in a wider perspective, to build a network of professional contacts, and to develop professional skills in a scientific environment.</AbstractNarration>
