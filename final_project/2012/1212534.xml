    <AbstractNarration>A scientific conference, Progress and Problems in Dynamics, will be held from Monday, May 14 until Wednesday May 16, 2012 at the Medical Center Hilton, Houston. The website for the conference is http://www.math.uh.edu/dynamics2012/ . The aim of the workshop is to bring together experts in the areas of probabilistic dynamics, network dynamics and hybrid dynamical systems so as to allow an exchange of techniques and insights as well as to foster collaboration on tackling some of the most significant and topical problems in these active research areas. So as to stimulate interaction, there will be broad expository talks in the morning and more focused seminars in the afternoon, with ample time set aside for detailed discussions and the initiation of research collaboration. Participants include researchers in the modern statistical theory of dynamical systems complemented by researchers in specific areas of dynamics and applications, in particular: heteroclinic phenomena; adaptive networks; spatially extended systems; mixed discrete and continuous dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of research in dynamical systems have many applications of important economic and strategic significance ranging from biological networks and neuroscience to control theory and engineering. A priority of the workshop is to support and introduce postdoctoral fellows, early career researchers and graduate students to this very active and important area of contemporary mathematical research. Attracting young talent into this field will promote successful research careers as well as contribute to the solution of the problems posed in the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
