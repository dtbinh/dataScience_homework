    <AbstractNarration>This Partnerships for Innovation project proposes to develop multigraft copolymer-based thermoplastic elastomers by use of randomly spaced side chains, representing a more cost effective technique than the present technique which depends on difficult to produce evenly spaced side chains. Thermoplastic elastomers combine the desirable properties of crosslinked elastomers (like car tires) with low processing costs and recyclability of thermoplastics. This newly developed class of multigraft copolymer-based thermoplastic elastomers is called "superelastomers" and holds promise for improved processability and recyclability of rubbery materials used in many different products such as gloves, earbuds, condoms, nipples for baby bottles, etc. The superelastomers also have the potential to open up new applications for elastomer materials. These designer elastomers constitute a new concept where macromolecular architecture (the shape of the molecule) is used to create the desired property profile. Through partnerships and collaborations fostered by this project, the research team will progress from knowledge generated by fundamental research toward new products that will enhance U.S. competitiveness, and the partner companies will have access to new designer elastomer technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are the creation of new jobs to stimulate the economy, and the reduction of the worldwide carbon footprint by developing a new class of highly tunable thermoplastic elastomers that have the potential to both be recyclable and reduce energy consumption during manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners at the inception of this project are the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (Department of Chemistry, School of Business Administration, and Research Foundation), BBB Elastomers (small business, Knoxville, TN), Asius Technologies (small business, Longmont, CO), InaMei Skin Care (small business, Hadley, MA), MAPA GmbH (large business, Zeven, Germany), Fuji Film (large business, Dayton, TN), Technology 20/20 (non-profit, Oak Ridge, TN), and Venture Incite (regional venture capital firm, Oak Ridge, TN).</AbstractNarration>
