    <AbstractNarration>The high-latitude North Pacific is a key region for understanding past changes in the ocean-climate system, yes it remains understudied and undersampled compared to similarly important regions of the global oceans. Attempts to model the North Pacific region at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) have produced divergent results, and currently no comprehensive paleoceanographic records exist to verify model output.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address this problem, this study will investigate North Pacific sea surface temperature and upper ocean changes at the LGM using a combined multi-proxy and multi-model synthesis approach. The project, led by faculty members at Oregon State University in collaboration with researchers in Portugal, will leverage sediment cores from previous field campaigns to obtain proxy data. The use of multiple proxies (oxygen isotopes, foraminiferal and diatom assemblages, Mg/Ca from planktonic foraminifera, clumped isotope analysis, and alkenone paleothermometry) will help to resolve inconsistencies and avoid biases produced by single-proxy reconstructions. Multi-proxy data will be compared with a synthesis of multiple models to establish constraints on the behavior of the North Pacific at the LGM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will produce a better understanding of North Pacific ocean-climate dynamics that are relevant to regional policy concerns (e.g., Alaskan glacier melt, changes affecting North Pacific fisheries). The project includes workforce development and mentoring at a wide range of levels, including post-doctoral associates in Portugal, a PhD student at OSU, an OSU undergraduate student from an underrepresented minority group, and high school students through the OSU Saturday Academy and NSF's Research Apprenticeships for High School Students program. OSU faculty members will work with National Park Service representatives to incorporate project results into outreach materials for three Alaskan National Parks and the NPS Climate Change Response program.</AbstractNarration>
