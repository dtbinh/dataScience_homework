    <AbstractNarration>This exploratory project applies the design approach of Named Data Networking (NDN) to generate benefits for cyberphysical systems (CPS). NDN is an emerging network architecture that shifts the thin waist of the Internet from IP's host-centric model to a data-centric model. It uses names to directly fetch data and binds names to data with cryptographic signatures. The project uses Building Automation Systems (BAS) as a driver and representative case of CPS encompassing the control, monitoring and management of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting, water, physical access control and other building systems. It will evaluate whether, in such real-world building automation systems, NDN can provide: (1) quantifiably better performance and reliability characteristics; (2) equivalent or better functionality for device addressing as typical middleware and application-specific protocols; (3) reduced application development complexity; (4) authentication, verification, and access control through fundamental NDN capabilities and strategies. The project also considers NDN device and service naming approaches that provide new functionality. To provide an environment on which to build and evaluate NDN support for BAS, the project will deploy a closed loop control system on the NDN testbed consisting of industry-standard electrical demand monitoring and lighting control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Cyberphysical systems are a new and rapidly progressing frontier in the broad use of computing technologies for critical infrastructure. However, existing CPS can be complex, often difficult to build and maintain, brittle to changes and vulnerable to faults resulting in potentially large impacts. This effort aims to pave a new direction that enables rapid development of reliable and secure CPS, and to bridge CPS with traditional IT for applications including energy management, remote operation, monitoring and data mining, and new types of human-computer interaction.</AbstractNarration>
