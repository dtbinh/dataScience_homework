    <AbstractNarration>Sixty years ago, barred tiger salamanders from Texas were introduced into California, where they hybridized with native, endangered California tiger salamanders. The result is a completely novel landscape in which some salamander populations are composed entirely of hybrid individuals and some are largely, or completely comprised of individuals with native genes. For the last 25 years, the Shaffer laboratory has collected and stored tissue samples from across the range of the California tiger salamander, providing a unique data set to study the distribution and spread of non-native genes. The current research project uses cutting-edge genomic tools to characterize historical and contemporary salamander populations, and to track the spread of thousands of non-native genes as they invaded the native range of the California tiger salamander over the last quarter century. Many species hybridize in nature, and the movement of genes between species is an important component of understanding how species adapt to changing environments. This project provides an unparalleled opportunity study the spread of genes between species in real time as it occurs in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research also addresses a fundamental, and difficult issue in the conservation of endangered species: what is the conservation value of hybrids? Hybridization is generally viewed as a serious threat to endangered species, since hybrids are not genetically the same as individuals in the ancestral species, and hybrids are usually not protected. This research will directly confront the role of hybrids in endangered species management by providing conservation agencies the opportunity to better understand how hybridization proceeds in nature. Additionally, the PIs will provide training and support for graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, and will contribute resources for K-12 education.</AbstractNarration>
