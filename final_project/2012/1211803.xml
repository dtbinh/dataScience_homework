    <AbstractNarration>The overarching objective of this project is to increase the participation of US students to advanced manufacturing research conferences. To address this objective, this award provides financial support to partially cover conference travel and registration to the 7th International Conference on MicroManufacturing (ICOMM'12) that will be held at Northwestern University (Evanston, Illinois) 12-14 March 2012. The 7th ICOMM will focus on technical presentations and panel discussions on the processes, equipment, and systems for fabricating miniature parts with micro-scale features. The conference will address theoretical and applied research issues on manufacture, assembly, and metrology of components and systems with micro-scale features. The requested funds will fully cover the registration for up to 30 students from US institutions, and will provide partial support to cover their travel expenses. The intellectual merit of this project arises from the technical interactions of the US graduate students with the academic and industrial researchers, as well as with other graduate students working in the manufacturing field. Since many international researchers attend ICOMM traditionally, the US graduate student will be also exchanging ideas regarding global aspects of manufacturing science and technology. This is critical in providing a complete education and high-level perspective to the future industrial leaders and academicians the US students will become.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educating the next generation of industrial leaders and academicians is vital to the future of the manufacturing field. Indeed, the recently-announced Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) initiative emphasizes the need for attracting and retaining the US students in the manufacturing field. The exchange of many new and innovative ideas during the ICOMM conference will address this goal directly, and will have a considerable impact to the future careers of the attending students, as well as to the future of manufacturing science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
