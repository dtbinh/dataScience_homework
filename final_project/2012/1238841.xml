    <AbstractNarration>The targeted infusion project of Claflin University has as its goal to enhance the scientific teaching and research infrastructure in the Department of Chemistry at Claflin University. This will be achieved with the upgrade and redesign of several chemistry laboratories and incorporation of summer and academic year undergraduate internships. As a result, Claflin University is expected to improve student retention in several gatekeeping chemistry courses, enhance the critical thinking skills of chemistry students and increase the overall retention rate of chemistry and biochemistry majors by 15%. Ultimately, the activities proposed for Claflin University will not only expose students to cutting edge research in the chemical sciences, but will also improve their capacities to compete for highly coveted undergraduate research opportunities. As such, it is expected that a significant percentage of Claflin students will, subsequently, matriculate into STEM graduate degree programs, thereby contributing to the diversification of the US STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>
