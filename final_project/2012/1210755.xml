    <AbstractNarration>Closely related populations or species often occupy ecologically disparate habitats. Adaptation to new habitats can eventually lead to speciation. Local adaptation to different environments has been repeatedly demonstrated in plants and animals; however, the traits and genes that underlie this adaptation are poorly understood. This study focuses on finding the traits and genes that allow two species of Monkeyflower, Mimulus laciniatus and the as yet unnamed Bald Rock Mimulus (BR), to survive in a unique habitat. Other closely related Mimulus species occur in streams and seeps, but M. laciniatus and BR have independently colonized a harsh granite outcrop environment. Another unique characteristic that both these species share is a lobed leaf shape. Because of the physiological properties of lobed leaves they are predicted to be adaptive in the dry, exposed granite outcrop environment. The PIs will use genome mapping, genetic manipulation, field experiments, and environmental manipulations to assess the adaptive significance of lobed leaves in the novel granite outcrop environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how plants adapt to harsh environments is essential for agricultural improvement and conservation, especially in light of climate change. If lobed leaf shape is important for adaptation to a dry environment then it could be incorporated into agricultural breeding programs. This project will also provide many opportunities to mentor undergraduates and high school students, including women and under-represented minorities, through programs at Duke and the Durham public schools.</AbstractNarration>
