    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;#1238407&lt;br/&gt;Chen, Yu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hyperspectral reflectance imaging (HRI) represents an emerging technology with a wide range of current and potential clinical applications including cancer detection and tissue oximetry. However, there is currently a lack of standardized methods to assure the quality and consistency of HRI imaging instruments. The lack of a standard battery of well-validated methods for objective, quantitative evaluation of HRI limits innovation in academia and industry and hampers the regulatory process by increasing the burden on manufacturers to develop preclinical test methods and perform clinical studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of new products. This proposed study will result in novel, validated image quality test methods and phantom fabrication techniques as well as improved understanding of spectral imaging systems such as those that have been submitted to FDA. Thus, this project will enhance FDA?s ability to rapidly evaluate innovative technologies based on HRI that have a strong potential to improve public health.</AbstractNarration>
