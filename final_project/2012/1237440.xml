    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Green chemistry and engineering offer fundamental and sustainable solutions to the global challenges facing the planet. Green chemistry is the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances. Green engineering is the development and commercialization of industrial processes that are economically feasible and reduce the risk to human health and the environment. Green chemistry and engineering are absolutely essential to the development of solutions to global challenges. Impact of green chemistry and engineering approaches on sustainable development are significant, since these design philosophies unite the pursuit of economic prosperity with environmental and public health protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference is organized each year by the American Chemical Society (ACS), Green Chemistry Institute (ACS GCI) with the active involvement of an organizing committee comprised of scientists from other nonprofit organizations, US government agencies, academic institutions and industry. Dr. David Wiley serves as the PI for the ACS Green Chemistry Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 16th Annual GC &amp; E Conference in 2012 will for the first time host a renewable energy session as part of the United Nations 2012 initiative "Sustainable Energy For All". The students participating in the GC&amp;E Workshop and Conference will have a unique opportunity to engage in topics not commonly encountered in traditional university courses. The 16th GC &amp;E Conference is scheduled for June 18-20, 2012 and will be held in Washington, DC. It will host a ceremony presenting the 17th Annual Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award winners. The GC&amp;E 2012 Conference theme is "Innovation, Jobs, Sustainability - The Role of Green Chemistry". Educating the innovators of tomorrow is a crucial part in securing the well-being of the future. This highly successful interdisciplinary conference and workshop provides a proven opportunity for students to learn to present research, learn the latest developments in green chemistry and engineering, and expose themselves to the broader economic, social and political context in which these developments occur.</AbstractNarration>
