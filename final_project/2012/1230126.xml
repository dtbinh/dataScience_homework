    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will deliver a mobile payment&lt;br/&gt;communications infrastructure, mobile device apps for utilizing that payment infrastructure,&lt;br/&gt;point-of-sale solutions for merchants that utilize the payment infrastructure, and will establish&lt;br/&gt;the framework for a local advertising network. The mobile payment system takes advantage of&lt;br/&gt;the speed of contemporary mobile devices to enable secure web-based transactions. This&lt;br/&gt;payment system revolutionizes payment by bypassing existing legacy credit and debit card&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure. New security algorithms and models will be developed to enable the secure&lt;br/&gt;transfer of banking information. The proposed payment system empowers consumers to control&lt;br/&gt;privacy, security, and localization settings in their mobile payment apps. The local advertising&lt;br/&gt;network changes the value proposition for both merchants and consumers with respect to ads and&lt;br/&gt;coupons, creating an environment in which merchants ?push? ads to ?pulling? customers. The&lt;br/&gt;local advertisement network will fundamentally alter the way users think about localization,&lt;br/&gt;privacy, and data anonymity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the creation of a payment&lt;br/&gt;system that revolutionizes commerce. The system will dramatically reduce or eliminate payment&lt;br/&gt;interchange fees for merchants, will move consumers much closer to the concept of a fully&lt;br/&gt;digital wallet, and will create a new level of engagement between merchants and consumers that&lt;br/&gt;is mutually beneficial. Small, independent merchants will immediately realize many of the&lt;br/&gt;benefits of the payment network. These merchants typically pay between $15,000 and $200,000&lt;br/&gt;annually in credit and debit card interchange fees. The proposed payment system will reduce or&lt;br/&gt;eliminate these fees enabling business expansion and job creation. The payment system&lt;br/&gt;effectively creates local commerce zones where ?buying local? is implicitly strongly encouraged&lt;br/&gt;through in-network, in-app local advertising, coupons, and loyalty programs. The payment&lt;br/&gt;system includes seamless peer-to-peer digital funds transfers. The ultimate goal is a payment&lt;br/&gt;system to make all commerce - all transfers of funds - frictionless, fast, simple, and easy. The&lt;br/&gt;mobile commerce market is expected to grow from over $200B this year to over $600B by 2015.&lt;br/&gt;The technology developed herein will be a vital driver of that growth.</AbstractNarration>
