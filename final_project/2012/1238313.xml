    <AbstractNarration>Planning Grant: I/UCRC for Area Wheat Genetics: Wheat Genetics Resource Center&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1238313 Kansas State University; Bikram Gill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kansas State University (KSU), as the lead institution, will partner with Oklahoma State University to establish an I/UCRC for Wheat Genetics that will feature integrated application of genomics, bioinformatics, high- throughput genotyping, mapping, phenotyping, and cytogenetics to accelerate alien gene introgressions for crop improvement. The proposed I/UCRC will build upon the already existing Wheat Genetics Resource Center (WGRC) at Kansas State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Managing bread wheat genetic diversity within domesticated varieties and wild wheat species, as well as workforce training, are critical success factors for the wheat research enterprise. Both will be major functions of the proposed I/UCRC. Adding value to wheat genetic resources will also be a major function of the proposed center. Another focus of the center will be mobilization of genetic diversity to improve crop performance. Finally, a key focus of the center will be the development of new methods for the rapid deployment of useful genetic diversity. Technical innovations will allow rapid transfer of useful traits to elite germplasm&lt;br/&gt;through genotyping by sequencing, marker assisted breeding and doubled haploid and other innovations by center scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary research impact of the proposed activity could be, potentially, the characterization (genotypic and phenotypic) of thousands of wild wheat relatives and alien introgression lines, a resource of immense value to the broader wheat improvement community (public and private). The value of this work will be even greater with the proposed I/UCRC investing effort in reducing the segments of alien introgressions carrying genes of interest to wheat improvement programs. WGRC's impressive track record of training and mentorship will be expanded upon in the new I/UCRC by providing additional training and educational activities including industry mentorship and internships, undergraduate research and potential dual degree programs in the plant sciences and various K-State departments.</AbstractNarration>
