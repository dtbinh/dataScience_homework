    <AbstractNarration>This is a continuation of Dr. Lazarian's theoretical work on the influence of magnetic field diffusion in turbulent star-forming clouds on the star formation process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The appearance, evolution, and overall properties of a spiral galaxy are strongly influenced by its interstellar medium (ISM). In turn, the nature of the ISM and many processes within it, such as star formation, are determined by the magnetic turbulence that stirs the ISM. Properties of turbulent fluids cannot be confidently understood using only numerical approaches; and the fluid motions simulated by computers differ from astrophysical ones by a huge difference in Reynolds numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present work focuses on the role that magnetic reconnection plays in star formation, and investigates the sources and effects of turbulence in different phases of the ISM. Although turbulence is chaotic, it can be described and understood by applying well defined statistical laws to solve astrophysical problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work improves the comparison of theory with observations. The studies employ well-tested numerical codes already in place. The principal investigator and his team will continue to develop, test, and apply new tools for extracting properties of turbulence (such as turbulence spectra and sonic Mach number of turbulence) from observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The statistical tools from this study are made publicly available and provide new tools to the observational community to study turbulence, its driving, and its magnetization. A graduate student will work on this project. This project also offers Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) students.</AbstractNarration>
