    <AbstractNarration>The PI and his collaborators will construct exoplanet atmospheric models that focus on the upper atmospheres. The models will include ion chemistry and track the distribution of ions and metals in the upper atmosphere to processes that occur in the lower atmosphere. They also plan to include the first calculations of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) heating efficiencies for highly irradiated planets (such as most Hot Jupiters). They also plan to include the calculations of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) heating efficiencies for highly irradiated planets (such as most Hot Jupiters). Thiss will have broader impacts in that it will train a graduate student and postdoctoral associate in research techniques, and they will communicate results through peer-reviewed articles, public lectures and articles to popular magazines.</AbstractNarration>
