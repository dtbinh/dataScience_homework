    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Kenneth Carter of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst will develop methodologies to form n- and p-type doped conjugated poly(ionomer)s from a single, neutral parent polymer. The approach is to synthesize conjugated polymers possessing benzimidazole repeat units either in homopolymer or copolymer form; to probe how acid-base and alkylation chemistries can be used to switch the benzimidazole repeat unit between various types of aromatic systems; to study systematically the effects of these modifications on the electrical and photo-physical behavior of the polymers; and to explore how these polymers can be used to fabricate functional organic electronic devices. The broader impacts involve training graduate and undergraduate students in polymer chemistry and organic electronics science, disseminating research results and concepts via publications, presentations at conferences and incorporation of material into lecture courses, and broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in chemical sciences via partnering with NOBCChE to bring undergraduates to campus for summer research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastics are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices. Electrically conducting carbon-based (organic) molecules and polymers hold enormous promise for realizing highly efficient, affordable, and broadly available electronic and optical devices. This research explores how chemistry can be used to control and switch the electronic properties of an electrically conducting polymer. Ultimately, such work could lead to the development of organic electronic materials, low cost solar cells, light emitting displays, and chemical and biological sensors.</AbstractNarration>
