    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Visar Ajeti of University of Wisconsin - Madison to conduct a research project, entitled "Microfabrication of extracellular matrix (ECM) at large scale," during the summer of 2012 at National Cheng-Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan. The host scientist is Dr. Shean-Jen Chen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in understanding and applying cell-matrix interactions using highly mimetic ECM models. The proposed research explores implanting highly mimetic ECM structures in animal models to get a better understanding of cell-ECM interaction. These studies can be used not only to understand basic biological principles in model systems but also permit the development of tools and drugs that have higher sensitivity and applicability in vivo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
