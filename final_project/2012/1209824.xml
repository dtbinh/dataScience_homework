    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Camerron M. Crowder of Oregon State University to conduct a research project, entitled "A window in time: impacts of increased seawater temperature on hormonal fluctuations in reproducing Taiwanese corals," during the summer of 2012 at National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium in Checheng Village of Pingtung County, Taiwan. The host scientist is Dr. Tung-Yung Fan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to provide insight into the initiation of reproduction in corals and to expand current understanding of the impacts of increased seawater temperature on hormone fluctuations and reproductive timing. Investigations include analysis of hormone fluctuations and larval release in normal and increased seawater temperatures, making possible estimates of coral reproduction resilience in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
