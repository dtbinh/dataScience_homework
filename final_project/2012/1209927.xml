    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Alexander Blair Cook of The University of Texas at Dallas to conduct a research project, entitled "Connecting stacked solar cells with carbon nanotube electrodes" during the summer of 2012 at Shimane University in Matsue, Shimane, Japan. The host scientist is Ichiro Hiromitsu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to better understand the physics of multi-junction solar cells as well to develop more effective techniques to incorporate carbon nanotubes into organic devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. This research promises to advance progress toward cost effective, light-weight and high efficiency solar energy for both consumer and industrial applications.</AbstractNarration>
