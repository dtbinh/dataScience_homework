    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Fenyang Stewart of North Carolina A&amp;T State University to conduct a research project, entitled "Developing computer programs that make human-like decisions to improve transportation systems," during the summer of 2012 at Beijing Jiaotong University in Beijing, China. The host scientist is Dr. Wenchuan Cai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is employing methods that use fuzzy logic to control transportation systems. Fuzzy Logic is a form of decision making that uses subjective language to describe and control systems. Fuzzy Logic can model non-linear systems that are mathematically difficult or impossible to model. Fuzzy logic is being applied to the control of high-speed trains, which is the preferred method of long-distance travel in China. This research has applications in the control of unmanned ground vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and nanosatellite swarms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
