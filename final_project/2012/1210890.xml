    <AbstractNarration>This project is a systematic investigation of cooling gas and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in cool core clusters, using adaptive mesh refinement simulations to resolve all cooling instabilities down to nearly the parsec scale. The first phase will focus only on radiative cooling, temporarily neglecting feedback in order to determine how gas cools in a cooling core. It will consider the effect of magnetic fields and anisotropic heat conduction, and evaluate the influence of gas temperature and potential well depth on the cooling catastrophe. The second phase will include AGN feedback, resolving down as far as the sphere of influence of the central supermassive black hole, in order to focus on different models for implementing jet-driven feedback. Detailed predictions of the X-ray, optical and radio emission properties of the cool core will serve as the diagnostics for testing the models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activities used to achieve the goals of this project will all involve training and public outreach, including a number of projects suitable for undergraduate students. The team has a good track record in these areas, and all members will continue to be involved in local activities, including a partnership with the American Museum of Natural History to generate high-quality visualizations. The adaptive mesh simulation code used in this study, called Enzo, is widely used by many researchers world-wide, and some effort will be invested to make it more complete, accurate and easy-to-use. The PI will hold regular (virtual) developer meetings to help to guide code development.</AbstractNarration>
