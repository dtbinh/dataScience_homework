    <AbstractNarration>CBET - 1247072&lt;br/&gt;PI: Kulacki &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A workshop grant request is requested for assessing emergent trends in heat transfer engineering, research, and education . The workshop will take place prior to the summer 2013 ASME Summer Heat Transfer Conference, marking the 75th anniversary of the ASME Heat Transfer Division. Broad challenges and future trends will be solicited from the technical community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Heat Transfer Conference will be held this year at the University of Minnesota, where the field of heat transfer has long been a signature program in the Mechanical Engineering program, where faculty have been widely recognized as international leaders in the field. A similar workshop was performed during the 50h anniversary of the heat division, and the PIs believe a similar analysis is necessary to assess current challenges and trends in the field to orient the next wave of young entrepreneurial scientists towards these nationally-relevant heat-transfer problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are requesting the financial support to conduct a pre-conference workshop on emergent trends in heat transfer engineering, research and education. A detailed report on the discussions and recommendations will be written and distributed to both US and international segments of the heat transfer community. A report on the findings of the workshop will be presented in either a session or forum at the 2013 International Mechanical Engineering Conference and Exposition. Concurrent with the workshop and 2013 Summer Heat Transfer Conference, special issues of the Journal of Heat Transfer&lt;br/&gt;and the Journal of Thermal Science and Engineering Applications will explore some of the issues to be addressed in workshop through focal articles and review papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will draw from a large cross-section of the community; the PIs propose to draw from the community broadly a vision of the pathways forward in heat transfer engineering, research and education, rather than develop a vision only through the advice of experts. Active participation and dialog will be key to this proposal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the workshop would inform industry, academia, and government on technology development, educational reform, and broader societal investments. Due to the solicitations from a broad community, a rich set of opinions to accurately and wisely guide the community are likely to be obtained. The results immediately following and during the workshop as well as a final report will be widely disseminated through traditional mechanisms and be made available to the public at large. A clear and logical project plan is provided.</AbstractNarration>
