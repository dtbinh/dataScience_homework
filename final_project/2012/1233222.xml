    <AbstractNarration>This award partially supports the travel of students and junior faculty from U. S. Universities to attend the 32nd IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS), which is to be held June 18-21, 2012. ICDCS has made significant impacts to the computing community since it was founded in 1979. The selected papers have influenced the design and implementation of many distributed computing systems, software and applications today. ICDCS has been an important venue for many graduate students and junior researchers around the world. In this conference, these young scholars interact with each other and learn the latest advances in distributed computing.</AbstractNarration>
