    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this grant is the development of physics-based crack evolution models in polycrystalline metallic materials for use in crystal plasticity finite element models. The unified deformation-fracture models will be developed by upscaling variables from atomic-scale, molecular dynamics simulations with explicit depiction of the atomic structure and deformation mechanisms. Upscaling will provide a framework for cohesive laws and associated evolution laws for deformation variables along specific slip systems. A systematic approach will be undertaken, encompassing the following tasks: (i) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 3D crystalline lattice systems to simulate the evolution of ductile and brittle crack evolution under a variety of force fields, (ii) development of accelerated MD methods to simulate longer time scales consistent with experiments, (iii) characterization and identification of crack tip deformation mechanisms, followed by quantification of the local atomic structure and evolution, and (iv) development of energy-based laws governing crack growth in the process zone by partitioning the total energy corresponding to different physical mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benefits to the scientific community will be accomplished through the establishment of novel crack evolution models of critical importance in analysis and design of materials for better fracture toughness and ductility. Advancement in accelerated molecular dynamics modeling will allow modeling at strain rates of realistic experiments. Collaboration with Sandia and Brown Deer Technology will enable technology transfer of deliverables for broader utilization. Students will have strong interactions with eminent researchers at Sandia National Laboratories and a small-scale development company to see the direct impact of their work.</AbstractNarration>
