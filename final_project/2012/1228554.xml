    <AbstractNarration>This project will support the Law and Social Science Pre-Dissertation Fellowship and Mentoring Program administered through the Law and Society Association (LSA) and the American Bar Foundation (ABF) in conjunction with a faculty advisory and mentoring board. NSF funding will support a national search to identify and recruit eight academically talented graduate students who will complete two-year fellowships in Law and Social Science in residence at the ABF over the next five years. In their residence at ABF, fellows will have office space and facilities and will participate in all the activities in which ABF dissertation fellows participate. Fellows will receive living stipends to support two years of graduate study in a Ph.D. program in the social sciences. LSA will match each fellow with two individual mentors who are established scholars in the law and social science field. Additionally, LSA will provide collective mentoring in partnership with ABF through a series of workshops, colloquia, and conferences for fellows designed to nurture and sustain intellectual networks between fellows and established scholars in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fellowships have two broad objectives: to enhance the capacity for rigorous, interdisciplinary, social scientific research on law and inequality, and to increase the diversity of scholars in the law and social science field, with special attention to increasing the number of researchers from underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities.</AbstractNarration>
