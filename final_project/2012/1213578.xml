    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Igor Alabugin of the Florida State University will develop a new approach to synthesizing graphene-like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via a cascade alkyne cyclization approach. The approach is to apply current radical cascade, alkyne cyclizations to the preparation of wider and longer polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, to modify the initiation and termination steps in the radical cascade to affect the formation of pentagonal subunits, and to introduce functional groups around the periphery of the product molecule, which will permit polarization of the carbon ribbons. The broader impacts involve training graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary research environment, broad dissemination of research results and concepts via publications, presentations and outreach activities, the potential societal impacts of new compounds for optical and electronic materials applications, and broadening participation of underrepresented groups in chemical sciences via collaboration with a research group at Bethune-Cookman University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing electronic devices using graphene nanoribbons, ultrasmall strips of matter comprised of a single layer of carbon atoms, has the potential to generate efficient, miniature devices; however, many significant technical hurdles must be overcome to realize the benefits. The project addresses an important, longstanding problem in synthesizing graphene nanoribbons for use in electronics and will further our understanding of this technologically important material. Such work could impact industries that use microprocessors in their products, including computer, consumer electronics, automotive, etc.</AbstractNarration>
