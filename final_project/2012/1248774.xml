    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Program (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a new high brightness light engine platform by monolithically integrating high performance silicon transistors with compound semiconductor optoelectronic materials. Dense arrays of light emitting diodes (LEDs) have been previously fabricated to show the opportunity of using such arrays in microdisplay and projection concepts. However, without active control circuits, the ultimate brightness and resolution are limited. The technology developed in this SBIR uniquely allows for the fabrication of LED arrays with integrated control circuits on a single substrate enabling a light engine platform with high peak brightness (20,000,000 cd/m2), high dynamic range (from low light to outdoor sunlight), and high efficiency (80 lm/W). Prototype LED arrays have been fabricated, and the next step to realize this platform is the development of silicon circuitry to directly control the LED arrays. The anticipated results of this SBIR Phase I project are a low-temperature thin-film transistor fabrication process compatible with the LED arrays, appropriately scaled transistors, models of device performance and uniformity, and fully developed control circuits that will enable commercial demonstration devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a light engine with a power efficiency, brightness, cost, and form factor unavailable in incumbent systems. In particular, three markets are identified where this technology significant advantages over current technologies, the $200 million microdisplay market, the $490 million pico-projector market, and the $2 billion projector market. This light engine platform offers a small form factor, long lifetime, environmental robustness, and high energy efficiency, and the high brightness required for sunlight readability. These features are necessary to create truly ubiquitous display devices and enable new see-through augmented reality experiences or smaller, more integrated projectors, not possible with current technologies. Commercialization of this device will impact all of these areas and enable a range of new downstream applications including other non-display industries, such as, 3D scanning and novel user interfaces.</AbstractNarration>
