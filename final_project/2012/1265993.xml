    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry supports the research efforts of Professor Adam S. Veige of the University of Florida to explore the use of trianionic pincer-supported transition metal catalysts for the production of value-added materials. This research is conducted in three parts. The first objective is to develop tungsten and molybdenum complexes using unique three-coordinated pincer ligands for alkyne metathesis - an organic reaction involving the redistribution of alkyne (triple) bonds. The trianionic ligand fuses three negatively-charged (anionic) donor groups to the meridional coordination plane, thus enabling access to highly-reactive, coordinatively and electronically unsaturated metal complexes. The second objective capitalizes on the preliminary discovery of highly-active substituted alkyne polymerization catalysts. Experiments elucidate the catalyst's role in the polymerization reaction, providing insight into the creation of new, more active versions of the catalyst. The third objective includes the development of catalysts capable of converting polyolefin waste into usable products. This project focuses on elucidating the rare, but fundamental beta-alkyl elimination reaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2010, the global demand for catalyst manufacturing reached $30 billion. These catalysts produced more than $10 trillion in goods and services annually. Catalyst development, such as that explored in this research project, broadens scientific knowledge and presents opportunities for discovering new catalysts and catalytic reactions. The underlying theme is to transform commodity or feedstock reagents into high-value products using non-precious metals to speed-up the reactions. Student scientists in the Veige research group receive hands-on training in modern inorganic/organometallic chemistry to meet the demands of an increasingly specialized technological workplace. In addition, interactive and entertaining events such as the Chemistry Day at the Oaks Mall are designed to raise public awareness and to inspire the next generation of scientists and their parents.</AbstractNarration>
