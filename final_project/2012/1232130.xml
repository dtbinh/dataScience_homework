    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the 21st International Workshop on Electromagnetic (EM) Induction in the Earth. This workshop is sponsored every two years by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) and is the primary forum for earth scientists in the world to share their EM research and plan international cooperative experiments. The workshop will be held in Darwin, Australia in July, 2012 and will be hosted by the Australian Society of Exploration Geophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EM measurements provide a unique view of the Earth because of the sensitivity of electrical conductivity to temperature, fluids, ore minerals, and lithologic variations. This sensitivity is important in monitoring environmental problems, exploring for energy and mineral occurrences, studying the interior structure of the Earth and other planets, and investigating regions of potential natural and man-made hazards (e.g., seismic, volcanic, unexploded ordinance).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support is being provided by the PI?s Australian colleagues from Australian organizations and international companies to help defray costs of the convention center rental, publication and publicity expenses, materials for participants, local transportation, and audiovisual equipment. The largest portion of the NSF funds will support travel for students and young scientists. There will also be support for a few senior scientists from developing countries.</AbstractNarration>
