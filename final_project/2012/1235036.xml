    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is exploring a novel mechanism of efficient charge transfer and transport using ferroelectric materials. To accomplish this goal, the proposed research will be focused on following tasks: 1) synthesis and preparation of inorganic and organic materials for light absorber and ferroelectricity, 2) device fabrication using various structure designs to take advantages from synthesized materials and 3) optical and electrical characterization as well as spectroscopic evaluation. As a transformative research, the successful outcomes will contribute to build a novel photovoltaic mechanism which can provide a major impact to overcome the obstacles in next generation solar cell. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is that it can discover unexplored physics from proposed ferroelectric assisted charge transport in nanostructured solar cell. Also, the research outcomes will provide the solutions and direction for nanomaterial based photovoltaic devices. Finally, it will lead the creation of a novel technology towards new next generation photovoltaic paradigm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are innovative curricular materials which emphasize nanotechnology and interdisciplinary research for the graduate students, and opportunities of research experience to the undergraduate students. The undergraduate research will focus on participation of underrepresented minority groups. Also, this program will benefit to renewable energy technology and related industry and scientific societies.</AbstractNarration>
