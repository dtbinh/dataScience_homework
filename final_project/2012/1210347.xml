    <AbstractNarration>The 25th Annual Cumberland Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing will be held May 10--12, 2012 on the campus of East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, TN. This annual conference on discrete mathematics provides a regional forum for the exchange of the latest research results and new directions of interests to researchers in the field. It also provides a stimulating and informative venue for new investigators; including undergraduate students, graduate students and recent PhDs. Over the past twenty-four years, the Cumberland Conference has developed a reputation for having high quality speakers and for providing a setting conducive to collaboration among the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the 2012 Cumberland Conference is reflected by its theme: Open Problems and Contemporary Conjectures. This conference plays a unique role as a regional exchange for researchers of all levels and has always actively promoted the initiation of new research collaborations. This year the conference topics include design theory, networks and their applications, hypergraphs, domination in graphs, graph coloring, extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, and degree distribution models. Four internationally-renown researchers have accepted invitations to be principal speakers: Jozsef Balogh (University of Illinois), Fan Chung (University of California, San Diego), Michael Henning (University of Johannesburg, South Africa), and Curt Lindner (Auburn University). The invited speakers and the conference participants are encouraged to give talks within the theme of the conference by including open problems and recently posed conjectures. The contemporary nature of the conference also encourages graph-theoretic models that are applicable in areas such as computer science, data mining, image capturing, and biological networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More details are available at http://www.etsu.edu/cas/math/cumberland</AbstractNarration>
