    <AbstractNarration>Until recently, the speed of a computer processors could be increased&lt;br/&gt;by packing more transistors into a smaller area and increasing the&lt;br/&gt;frequency. This trend is now unsustainable because of power&lt;br/&gt;constraints, with only moderate gains going forward even when putting&lt;br/&gt;hundreds or thousands of traditional cores onto a chip. Thus, how to&lt;br/&gt;reduce power consumption while increasing performance is one of the&lt;br/&gt;core concerns. It is well-accepted that specialization (designing&lt;br/&gt;parts of the processor for a specific task) and heterogeneity&lt;br/&gt;(designating different parts of the processor for different tasks) can&lt;br/&gt;lead to orders of magnitude improvements in both aspects. However,&lt;br/&gt;the question is whether such efficiency can be maintained while&lt;br/&gt;providing enough flexibility to implement a broad class of operations.&lt;br/&gt;Leveraging unique domain expertise, research under this project&lt;br/&gt;addresses this question for the domain of matrix computations, which&lt;br/&gt;are at the core of many computational advances, both in scientific&lt;br/&gt;high-performance computing as well as in the embedded, mobile or&lt;br/&gt;cyber-physical domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observing that the largest benefits can be obtained through&lt;br/&gt;specialization at the foundations, this project is aimed at&lt;br/&gt;co-designing algorithms and architectures to directly realize basic&lt;br/&gt;linear algebra methods in an optimized combination of hardware and&lt;br/&gt;software. By designing a specialized Linear Algebra Processor (LAP),&lt;br/&gt;it is possible to achieve one to two orders of magnitude improved&lt;br/&gt;efficiencies compared to traditional or proposed computer&lt;br/&gt;architectures. The questions that the project will answer, through a&lt;br/&gt;combination of analysis, simulation, and prototyping, include: (1) How&lt;br/&gt;to best design such LAPs that can efficiently execute the full set of&lt;br/&gt;linear algebra routines; and (2) How LAPs can be scaled, networked&lt;br/&gt;into clusters and integrated with application software running on one&lt;br/&gt;or more host processors. The broad goal of this project is to develop&lt;br/&gt;novel, integrated linear algebra compute fabrics that are co-optimized&lt;br/&gt;and co-designed across all layers ranging from the basic hardware&lt;br/&gt;foundations all the way to the application programming support through&lt;br/&gt;standard linear algebra software packages. This project is expected&lt;br/&gt;to result in a leap in computational science and discovery&lt;br/&gt;capabilities, thus enabling novel breakthroughs in industry, for the&lt;br/&gt;consumer, at the national labs, in education and by scientists in&lt;br/&gt;academia.</AbstractNarration>
