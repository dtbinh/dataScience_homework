    <AbstractNarration>A new site is to be planned at Purdue University for the Net-Centric Software and Systems Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC). The planned Purdue Site intends to focus on research supporting the design, implementation and deployment of highly reliable and secure software and systems in net-centric and cloud environments. The planned site intends to advance real-time mobile-cloud centric computing, improve performance of real-time analysis of big data and data-centric computing, enhance privacy and security in net-centric computing and realize information flow tracking and auditing in net-centric environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned center site has the potential to help meet an industry need for research and development to restructure software design and execution and system implementations for networked and cloud computing environments. The planned center site at Purdue University has the potential to further expand the diversity of member companies in the overall center and expose all member firms to a broader base of discovery in the net-centric area. Student engagement in center research promises to provide graduates with a broad, industry-oriented perspective of their research and practice. Dissemination of the research results will be achieved through publications at conferences and journals as well as special seminars to be organized by the PI and collaborators that can serve to increase awareness of the problems faced by industry in net-centric computing.</AbstractNarration>
