    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary &lt;br/&gt;Doctoral Dissertation Research: Schools, Families and Children's Food Allergies&lt;br/&gt;Peter Conrad&lt;br/&gt;Vanessa Lopes Mu√±oz&lt;br/&gt;Brandeis University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 4% of children reported a food allergy in 2007-an increase of nearly 18%&lt;br/&gt;during the course of a decade. Preventing and responding to severe allergic reactions can&lt;br/&gt;require the involvement of many actors in schools, restaurants, and childcare centers. By&lt;br/&gt;examining how multiple actors adhere to food allergy policies and guidelines, this study&lt;br/&gt;seeks to fill an existing gap in sociological studies of health and illness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. A longstanding concern in sociology and in medicine is explaining&lt;br/&gt;under what conditions, and to what ends, people adhere to medical regimens. Conrad and&lt;br/&gt;others have argued that ill persons make decisions about following medical regimens&lt;br/&gt;largely based on their everyday lives, making the case that daily social interactions are at&lt;br/&gt;least as important as doctor-patient relationships. Conditions that are managed primarily&lt;br/&gt;through lifestyle changes,such as changes in diet,raise questions about the role of&lt;br/&gt;multiple actors in managing health conditions. To address these questions, this study&lt;br/&gt;examines how families and schools adhere to food allergy policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. This study would expand knowledge about the management of health&lt;br/&gt;conditions that are rising in prevalence-food allergies. Results from this study may&lt;br/&gt;inform health policies related to an array of conditions that require intensive lifestyle&lt;br/&gt;changes, such as asthma, diabetes, and food intolerances. Findings may also be of interest&lt;br/&gt;to healthcare professionals, families, and school administrators. This research will be&lt;br/&gt;used for a doctoral dissertation and in undergraduate teaching.</AbstractNarration>
