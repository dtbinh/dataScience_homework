    <AbstractNarration>This project aims to minimize fuel consumption and travel times by finding common meeting locations for groups of users who are looking to minimize the maximum or total distance/time traveled. Researchers aim to provide an instant solution to the above class of problems. This project plans to capture the underlying geometry of the road network graphs and use efficient computational geometric tools to solve the problem. Researchers experimentally determine a method to cast the entire road network graph in a low dimensional Euclidean space, in order to exploit the geometrical structure of the graph. When query points are fed from different locations of the road network, geometric algorithms are used to find the solution instantly, but approximately. Query points represent the users. Initial experiments on real world data sets indicate fast computation of constant factor approximate solutions for query sets much larger than previously computable using exact techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project plans to develop new techniques for computing centers on road networks. The results could make a large contribution to energy usage, air pollution and to internet maps in general as it is designed to enable users to make travel decisions that could lower fuel consumption thus potentially reducing emissions and pollution. This project is designed to be used as a web/mobile-based application for its end-users. A web/mobile platform has the potential to make this application a useful part of travel planning for a variety of end-users.</AbstractNarration>
