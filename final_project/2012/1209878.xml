    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Keiko M. Tuttle of Washington State University, Pullman, WA to conduct a research project, entitled "Investigating the control of wheat seed dormancy and germination by plant hormones," during the summer of 2012 at RIKEN Plant Science Center in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture. The host scientist is Dr. Mitsunori Seo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to advance knowledge about the hormonal control of wheat seed dormancy and germination by measuring hormones Abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), and jasmonic acid (JA) levels in seeds that are either dormant or subjected to dormancy-breaking treatments. It is essential to advance knowledge about the hormonal control of seed dormancy directly in wheat where problems with preharvest sprouting of seed on the mother plant due to insufficient dormancy under cold or moist conditions cause economic losses for farmers. Identification and localization of the hormone signal for dormancy release could transform current knowledge leading to new breeding strategies for preharvest sprouting tolerance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of Japan; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally awareness of the U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
