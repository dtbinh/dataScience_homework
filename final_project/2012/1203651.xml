    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this study is to understand how adolescents understand the school climate around race and diversity. Schools where individuals interact positively and respectfully across racial boundaries promote the wellbeing of youth of all races, but existing research is limited in several ways. Much of existing research focuses on a few narrow features of the school, such as discrimination or diversity programming. Research has also typically focused on diverse schools rather than schools that range in racial composition. Finally, most research focuses on students of color, so less is known about how White students think about race in their schools. The current study builds on the principal investigator's dissertation work by using interviews and focus groups to explore how youth of multiple races perceive their schools in schools that vary in their racial make-up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants are 40-50 middle and high school students who are completing focus groups and individual interviews. Additionally, a small group of students are being trained to interview their peers about how they perceive their school climate. The students are drawn from two districts in Southeastern Michigan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The current study contributes to theory and research seeking to understand how youth conceptualize their school racial climates. The comprehensive framework being developed in this work will also inform school improvement efforts and teacher training by providing specific areas of focus and predictions for how varied initiatives may impact student attitudes, engagement, and achievement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;In the long term, this research will contribute to schools being able to prepare youth to live and work in an increasingly diverse society. In the short term, this project is developing the principal investigator's skill and expertise with qualitative research, new theoretical perspectives, and her ability to connect research to educational practice. This research will produce materials appropriate for teacher education courses and professional development. Finally, the findings will be disseminated to the scientific community to advance the literature on the role of race in the lives of adolescents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadening Participation&lt;br/&gt;The project broadens participation of underrepresented groups in the social sciences by involving minority undergraduate and graduate students as research assistants. The project also introduces participants, most of whom are from underrepresented groups, to research as a career and gives them the opportunity to collect data in their schools and communities, analyze the data and present their findings. The participants also receive mentoring from undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
