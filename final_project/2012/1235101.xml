    <AbstractNarration>This project will support the evaluation and development of micro-sequential Lab-On-Valve methodology used for determination of trace elements in seawater, which has potential as a new analytical system to be used in ocean observing systems. Sequential Injection methodology will be adapted to oceanographic trace element determinations and thus become a significant contributor to a new generation of analytical systems that are needed to utilize the expanding array of platforms dedicated to unattended data gathering. These platforms such as moorings, floats, and gliders, provide an opportunity to extend data gathering beyond the reach of conventional shipboard sampling and hence improve our understanding of long term temporal processes as well as access to areas that are logistically difficult to reach. The ocean sciences community at large will therefore benefit from the development of the new micro-fluidic technologies for trace element analysis. A further benefit will be the training of graduate students that represent the next generation of specialists in the development and application of this novel trace element analytical technology.</AbstractNarration>
