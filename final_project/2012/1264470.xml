    <AbstractNarration>Point-of-care devices require simple yet inexpensive platforms with high&lt;br/&gt;sensitivity from complex media. Paper is the least expensive platform for assay&lt;br/&gt;development and often allows results to be obtained faster than conventional sensors.&lt;br/&gt;Current efforts to improve paper-based detection technologies rely on physically&lt;br/&gt;adsorbed ligands (with limited ligand amount and activity), rely on blocking agents to&lt;br/&gt;passivate nonspecific protein adsorption (with limiting detection sensitivity and suitable&lt;br/&gt;only for simple media or diluted samples), and suffers from low sample retention due to&lt;br/&gt;the rapid evaporation of samples (typically receiving less than 50% of the original&lt;br/&gt;sample in the detection zone). Zwitterionic poly(carboxybetaine) (PCB) surface coatings&lt;br/&gt;have been able to achieve highly sensitive and specific detection from undiluted human&lt;br/&gt;plasma and serum. The objective of this work is to realize inexpensive, yet highly&lt;br/&gt;sensitive paper-based detection from complex media using zwitterionic chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
