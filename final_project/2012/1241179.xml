    <AbstractNarration>Biological collections are an irreplaceable resource that informs our scientific understanding of the history and diversity of life on Earth. The value of these research collections is greatly enhanced when the specimens and data are digitized and made widely and publically available. The biodiversity collections community recently united to develop a ten-year Strategic Plan for establishing a Network Integrated Biocollections Alliance (NIBA), but to date, no detailed community-informed plan has been developed to guide the implementation of that Strategic Plan. The American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS) will conduct a workshop of diverse stakeholders with the specific goal of deriving a detailed implementation plan for the NIBA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A detailed community-informed plan will help the scientific community more effectively curate specimens and data, increase research productivity by improving access to collection resources, develop innovative tools to capture and validate data, develop protocols that enhance the efficiency of digital capture, and provide education and training to develop the biodiversity collections workforce. As data and specimens are captured and made publically available, there will be new opportunities for the public to access and learn about biodiversity and Earth systems, and the plan will recommend methods to promote citizen science activities to expose the public directly to these scientific resources.</AbstractNarration>
