    <AbstractNarration>The morphological differences within and between species are largely the result of differences in development. It is poorly understood how the development of an organ can impact the resulting adult morphology and how this might constrain or enhance evolution. This dissertation research will investigate the developmental basis of evolutionary change in ovarian morphology in Drosophilid flies. In these flies, as in all insects, the ovary is divided into substructures called ovarioles that act as assembly lines for egg production. The number of ovarioles has a large impact on reproductive capacity, as flies with more ovarioles can lay more eggs. Ovariole number can evolve rapidly among closely related species and is sometimes correlated with the specific environment (niche) where larvae feed and grow. The PIs will investigate ovary development of species with diverse ovariole numbers to understand (1) how different developmental changes alter ovariole number, and (2) how niche-specialization influences ovariole number evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will combine lab and field work to provide insights into how the development of the ovary influences its evolutionary trajectory. In addition, this research will provide training for undergraduate students, including members of underrepresented minorities. Hawaiian Drosophilids will also be used to educate elementary school children at a local afterschool art program, where students will learn about the function of different morphological features through drawing.</AbstractNarration>
