    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1216461 PI: Zhang, Liangfang ORG: UC San Diego&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: EAGER: Red Blood Cell Membrane Camouflaged Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The research objective of this award is to study an innovative biomimetic nanoparticle platform that uses natural red blood cell (RBC) membranes, rather than conventional synthetic stealth biomaterials, to cloak synthetic nanoparticles for drug delivery. The approach taken will be to utilize a novel and revolutionary top-down strategy to functionalize nanoparticles by transferring the entire cellular 'utility coat' of an RBC onto the surface of drug nanocarriers. A nanoparticle thus modified is expected to exhibit similar physiologic behavior as its source cells. To achieve the primary goal, two specific research tasks will be pursued in the proposed project: (i) study the physicochemical and biological properties the RBC membrane cloaked polymeric nanoparticles, and (ii) explore effective approaches to incorporate targeting ligands on the surface of the RBC membrane cloaked nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: If successful, this project will develop an entirely new class of biomimetic nanoparticles that combines RBC membranes with synthetic biomaterials. Such a combination of natural cellular components with synthetic biomaterials presents an innovative approach to develop novel and powerful drug delivery nanocarriers and will have profound impacts on the fields of biomaterials research and nanotechnology drug delivery. Moreover, this work highly integrates research and education. Two education thrusts will be carried out during the period of this project: (i) The PI will create new courses to shape and impact the development of the first undergraduate curriculum in 'nanoengineering' in the Untitled States. This curriculum will be provided as a model for the development of similar programs at other institutions. (ii) The PI will collaborate with the UCSD ET-CURE Program to provide minority undergraduate students with stimulating research experiences. The PI will recruit 1-2 minority undergraduate students to work on this project.</AbstractNarration>
