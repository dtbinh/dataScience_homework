    <AbstractNarration>The 8th International Nanotechnology Conference on Communication and Cooperation (INC8) will bring together some of the world?s most renowned and technologically advanced thinkers to exchange information and ideas with regards to nanotechnology, nano-optics and nanoelectronics. This arena will provide a unique opportunity where academics and industry leaders can interact on issues in nanotechnology. Current issues that will be discussed includes energy and environmental challenges facing mankind in particular targeting to decrease CO2 emissions and increase the viability of renewable energy solutions - and the associated societal implication and issues. Also, another major challenge that will be discussed includes a look at logic switch replacement technologies for CMOS and what alternate state variables are viable options. Semiconductor industry related questions and topics that will be discussed include nanoscale interconnects, thermal management, directed self-assembly, and fault tolerance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to further strengthen the continuous dialogue between Europe, Japan and the United States, broad regional overviews will be combined with detailed presentations from each of the regions. Senior researchers from industry, academia, leaders and policy makers from North America, Europe and Asia will hold discussions on a variety of efforts in nanoscience, along with opportunities for collaboration. Young scientists will also be invited to present posters highlighting their work. The meeting will target groups at co-operating to implement strategic programs to progress human development through nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
