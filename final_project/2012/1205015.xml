    <AbstractNarration>Madison Area Technical College (MATC), in collaboration with the Consortium for Education in Renewable Energy Technology (CERET), offers Train the Trainer Academies for high school and two-year college instructors in renewable energy technologies, and Renewable Energy Certificates to students through online and face-to-face courses. This project strengthens and expands the current model by developing new professional development offerings and certificates in both bioenergy and advanced solar photovoltaics. The primary project goal is to provide renewable energy expertise to two-year college and high school instructors around the country, while creating model career pathways that give students broad skill sets and flexibility in tough and unpredictable labor markets. New courses and certificates in second and third generation biofuels and advanced solar photovoltaics will be the primary products of this effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year project addresses a critical need for community college and high school faculty professional development in renewable energy technologies to meet the growing student interest and demand for training in these job growth areas. Participating faculty enhance their content knowledge and skills related to renewable energy technology through hands-on training. As part of the biofuels training, participants learn about second and third generation biofuels, produce biodiesel fuel, perform tests on fuel samples, measure emissions on petroleum and biofuels and discuss and share techniques for teaching about biofuels. In the Advanced Photovoltaics Academy, participants practice installation, inspections, trouble-shooting, repair, and decommissioning of solar electric systems. Concurrent development of new, renewable energy certificates in these two areas provides current students the opportunity to specialize in renewable energy within traditional employment fields and provides incumbent workers in a variety of technical fields the opportunity to retool and become more competitive in green energy occupations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To enhance the impact of the Train the Trainer model, the project targets faculty from campuses that lack the resources for professional development such as: from small institutions, from remote geographic areas, and from schools that serve minorities, economically disadvantaged, and other underrepresented groups. Communication and collaboration between high school and two-year college faculty participating in the Academies, in turn, helps to build career pathways for students as they transition from high school to college to the workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This faculty professional development model and certificate program helps to meet the growing demand for renewable energy technicians in the biofuel and solar electric industries. The new courses and associated materials are available through CERET and other renewable energy organizations so that other schools can cultivate renewable energy courses on their campuses, even during lean budget years.</AbstractNarration>
