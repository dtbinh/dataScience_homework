    <AbstractNarration>Deaf researchers are underrepresented in sign language research. The aim of this project is to broaden the participation of deaf individuals in disciplines that conduct sign language research. Funding will be used to bring U.S. deaf college students to the Theoretical Issues in Sign Language Research (TISLR) conference that will be hosted in London during the summer of 2013 and to provide American Sign Language interpreting services for these students at the conference. TISLR is the most significant and well-attended international sign language research conference. Immediately prior to TISLR, the students will also participate in a three-day Sign Language Researchers' Toolkit training that will be offered by the Deafness, Cognition, and Language Centre at the University College London. The training will include hands-on experience with state-of-the-art equipment and software for analyses and documentation of signed languages. The knowledge, skills, resources, and networks the students will acquire in London at the training and at TISLR will make them better equipped to develop careers in sign language research.</AbstractNarration>
