    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Amanda B. Young of Penn State University to conduct a research project, entitled "A comparison of gymnosperm and angiosperm treeline development," during the summer of 2012 at Shinshu University in Matsumoto/Nagano Prefecture. The host scientist is Dr. Koichi Takahashi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to contribute to understanding of why some treelines are composed of angiosperms while others are dominated by gymnosperms. Moreover, with increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, projected increases in temperature, and changes in the quantity and timing of precipitation, it is important to conduct this study to generate data on key processes that can contribute to efforts to model ecosystem responses to a changing climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
