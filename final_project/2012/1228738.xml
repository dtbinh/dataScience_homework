    <AbstractNarration>This NSF MRI award funds the acquisition of a state-of-the-art rock triaxial testing system, which is the centerpiece of the Geo-Mechanics and Geo-Imaging laboratory at the University of North Florida. The testing system couples hydrological, geophysical, and mechanical (static and dynamic compression) testing capabilities under triaxial conditions. The rock triaxial testing system augments existing specimen preparation equipment, pre-test characterization equipment, index test equipment, and acoustic emission monitoring equipment to create a unique experimental rock characterization facility at a predominately undergraduate institution. Projects to be supported by the testing system include characterization of the properties and behavior of brittle macroporous materials; addressing technical issues that will allow engineers to design economic; sustainable subsurface infrastructure in weathered Florida limestone; and developing knowledge that will allow engineers, scientists, and policy makers to assess the potential for geologic carbon sequestration in the state of Florida. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The triaxial testing system supports cutting edge instruction, education, and research in geological material characterization at the University of North Florida. Possessing this unique experimental characterization system enhances numerous multidisciplinary collaborative research projects with researchers within and outside of the state of Florida. Experimental data generated using the rock triaxial testing system is disseminated to researchers and educators using a dedicated web-based digital library. Beyond students, faculty and researchers, the broader community which benefits from this system includes high school students who participate in outreach activities within the University of North Florida's School of Engineering and state policy makers who decide upon state endeavors into geologic carbon sequestration.</AbstractNarration>
