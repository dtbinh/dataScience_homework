    <AbstractNarration>Operating systems and networks developed largely independently, due to&lt;br/&gt;the nature of their development -- operating systems were developed by&lt;br/&gt;groups within organizations/companies, while networking requiring&lt;br/&gt;interoperability was developed across organizations. As a result of&lt;br/&gt;this development history, the boundary between the networking&lt;br/&gt;subsystem and the rest of the operating system has remained largely&lt;br/&gt;opaque, with little information regarding the performance or progress&lt;br/&gt;of transfers being communicated to applications. This research&lt;br/&gt;addresses this limitation by exploring a richer boundary interface&lt;br/&gt;that allows programs to see the ongoing behavior of network transfers&lt;br/&gt;and to control their operation at a fine granularity. These interfaces&lt;br/&gt;would augment, rather than replace, the existing interfaces, so the&lt;br/&gt;portions of programs that are satisfied with the current interfaces&lt;br/&gt;could continue unmodified, and developers could change only the&lt;br/&gt;portions that can benefit from richer information. This research is&lt;br/&gt;largely experimental in nature, and will combine the design and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of new interface abstractions along with the&lt;br/&gt;development of new or modified programs to take advantage of these&lt;br/&gt;interfaces. In addition to the design work associated with the&lt;br/&gt;interfaces, additional criteria for success include examining the&lt;br/&gt;performance and delay behavior of modified applications, and the&lt;br/&gt;effort needed to modify such applications. The expected results from&lt;br/&gt;this work include applications that can more precisely control their&lt;br/&gt;networking behavior, reducing memory and processor usage, improving&lt;br/&gt;energy efficiency, and improving delay behavior. High-performance or&lt;br/&gt;time-sensitive applications, such as networked video, should benefit&lt;br/&gt;from this research.</AbstractNarration>
