    <AbstractNarration>This Partnerships for Innovation Project from Case Western Reserve University focuses on co-extrusion of multilayer polymer films for various potential applications such as gas barrier films for food packaging, optical films and lenses, and electronic/optoelectronic films. A recent discovery enables a new application of multilayer films in dielectric films for high energy density and low loss capacitors. Potential applications of this research platform on multilayer film capacitors will include smaller capacitors with high efficiencies, pulsed power electronics, dc-link capacitors for hybrid electric vehicles, grid-tie inverters and converters, and many others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research include the following: First, this project will serve as a university model for translating knowledge and technology to market-valued solutions. If successful, the project will have a direct impact on the local and national economy by crystallizing cutting edge technology in Northeast Ohio for U.S. polymer dielectric film production and capacitors. Second, students and faculty will learn innovation skills that bridge the gap between industrial needs and discovery research. Third, this project will provide mutual incentives to the team via collaboration and maximization of resources. In this project, a Master of Engineering and Management student will be involved in market analysis and product design. Finally, this project will outreach to K-12 education by participating in a successful education program developed by the NSF Center for Polymeric System (CLiPS), the Polymer Envoys Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners at the inception of the project are Case Western Reserve University as the lead academic institution, PolymerPlus LLC (Valley View, OH) and Orbital Research, Inc. (Cleveland, OH).</AbstractNarration>
