    <AbstractNarration>One of the critical problems---if not the critical problem---in&lt;br/&gt;reaching the exascale computing goal by the end of the decade is the&lt;br/&gt;power problem. Exascale systems have a target power constraint of 20&lt;br/&gt;megawatts even though today's petascale systems---which have&lt;br/&gt;performance at least two orders of magnitude below prospective&lt;br/&gt;exascale systems---generally consume around 5 megawatts. Hardware&lt;br/&gt;improvements alone will not bridge this gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is developing a run-time system called Conductor to address the&lt;br/&gt;power issue. The overall goal of Conductor is to produce near-optimal&lt;br/&gt;application performance under a prescribed power bound. Conductor&lt;br/&gt;carries this out by allocating power both between and within nodes.&lt;br/&gt;First, the PI is designing and implementing a new technique called&lt;br/&gt;power scheduling, which addresses the inter-node case. The second&lt;br/&gt;part of Conductor addresses the intra-node case with power gating,&lt;br/&gt;which allows powering off of individual components in a more&lt;br/&gt;fine-grain manner than is generally available in architectures today.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the PI is investigating techniques to allow users to assist&lt;br/&gt;Conductor, through annotations, in achieving high performance in cases&lt;br/&gt;where power scheduling and power gating alone are not sufficient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of the research described in this proposal is significant.&lt;br/&gt;Conductor is essential to achieving exascale performance on nontrivial&lt;br/&gt;applications, and it will help push towards the exascale goal.&lt;br/&gt;Achieving exascale performance is an important national priority and&lt;br/&gt;will impact many application domains. The PI is also integrating the&lt;br/&gt;research ideas into both undergraduate and graduate parallel and&lt;br/&gt;distributed computing courses.</AbstractNarration>
