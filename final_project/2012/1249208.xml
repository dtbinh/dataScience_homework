    <AbstractNarration>In this project the PI will explore a novel experimental and methodological framework for measuring and understanding the role of stress in student performance on exams. Stress is defined here as sympathetic arousal, an ever-present mechanism that helps humans cope with perceived threats or challenges. The planned experiments, in which criticality and computer-mediation define the two axes of the experimental space, will cover a rich set of combinations that include bi-weekly exams each of which counts for a small percentage of the grade vs. midterm and final exams that each count for a large percentage of the grade, alternately offered in paper and iPad forms. Subjects will be randomly divided into control and interventional groups; in the interventional group the time will be relaxed, to determine the effect of stress reduction on the evolution of competency. Unobtrusive measurements (to ensure non-interference with the observed behaviors) will span the genetic, physiological and psychological levels, while micro to macro measurements will afford a deep understanding of the issues. While most HCI-related projects aim to change the design of the interface, this research instead investigates the possibility of "changing" the human (student) by revolutionizing relevant aspects of the educational system. Improving the human-computer interface is a secondary aim where, depending upon the success of the intervention, stress-reduction designs can be conceived to counter-balance the time stressor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research tries to identify and suggest ways to correct problems in paper- vs. computer-mediated exams, precipitated by strong sympathetic responses. To this end the PI explores the role of the time stressor, and in so doing questions certain aspects of the prevailing educational philosophy.</AbstractNarration>
