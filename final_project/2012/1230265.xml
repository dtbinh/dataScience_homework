    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on the enablement of comparative effectiveness research (CER), evidence based medicine (EBM), and personalized medicine (PM) by researchers utilizing both clinical and complex biomolecular data. The first phase of this grant was focused on a feasibility study working with customers to determine the extent to which the tools we were creating would and could be utilized in practice. This phase is focused on implementation of these tools in real-world health care environments and creating systemic improvements of healthcare by improving tools available for self-evaluation by hospital administrators and clinicians alike. There will be four key objectives accomplished as a result of this proposal. The first is the development of care-improvement algorithms for pediatric ICU patients with sepsis and congenital heart disease. The second will be a reporting engine that mines electronic medical records to create CER reports for patients. The third is an easy-to-use enterprise level reporting engine to check compliance with national standard health care quality metrics and to create new metrics for care improvement. The final objective is to create a personalized medicine reporting system based on next generation sequencing data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant because it capitalizes on two trends in health care - digitizing patient clinical data and the increasing use of molecular sequencing and microarray data. The commercialization of the technical innovations referenced in this project will enable researchers and clinicians to generate true Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER), Evidence-based precision medicine (EMB) and Personalized Medicine reports (PMR). The ultimate objective of this technology is improving patient outcomes. Leveraging historical patient data in CER to eliminate ineffective therapies from the health care system, coupled with utilizing genetic information to create a more personalized model of health care, will focus precious health care dollars on effective therapies optimized for the individual. Ultimately, this tool will be appealing to every segment of the health care industry including clinicians, researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and insurance companies due to the increases in quality and cost savings that will be created.</AbstractNarration>
