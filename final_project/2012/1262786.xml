    <AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the University of Vermont (UVM) that will provide research training for 8 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013- 2015. The program focuses on Neuroscience -- the investigation of the molecular, cellular and physiological processes important for nervous system function that ultimately regulate animal and human behavior. The university-wide Neuroscience Program at UVM has about 50 faculty who will serve as mentors. There is a wide range of exciting projects for the students. Projects include the investigation into the function of nerve cell specific genes, the development and plasticity of neural circuits, the physiological function of select nerve cells, and studies of animal and human behavior. Students are expected to do full-time lab research as well as participate in seminars and various workshops, such as the responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process. Students are also interacting with the leaders of local neuroscience related companies, such as MBF Bioscience and Med-Associates. REU students have access to a rich array of individual mentor?s facilities as well as many interdepartmental core facilities such an imaging core with multiple advanced microscopes, and a molecular core dedicated to the quantitative analysis of DNA, RNA and proteins. The program?s multi-phase recruitment effort consists of both traditional "hard copy" formats as well as digital-based advertising. Students are selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding neuroscience research. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool available to BIO-funded REU PIs. More information is available by visiting Neuroscience REU at UVM, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Felix Eckenstein at Felix.Eckenstein@uvm.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Eugene Delay at Eugene.Delay@uvm.edu).</AbstractNarration>
