    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project?s objective is to develop a system level framework for patient monitoring. This framework is intended to allow the interoperability of various patient monitoring devices; data preprocessing and fusion to detect the data inconsistencies and determine session and data prioritization; and bandwidth-adaptive data and video transmission driven by real-time prioritization. The proposed research will lead to the evolution of protocols that can be used for providing interoperability among various physiological measurement devices/sensors, and will have applications in numerous healthcare domains such as home healthcare, post-operative care, preventive care, adult care and nursing homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the proposed work have the potential to impact the medical sciences, healthcare and computer science, enabling an information rich environment with which medical care and outcomes may be significantly improving. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as an individual industry member of the center and has the potential to extend the center?s portfolio. The PIs will disseminate the results of the work using the already established TerraFly web-based data dissemination tool.</AbstractNarration>
