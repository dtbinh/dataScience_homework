    <AbstractNarration>This award to the University of Rochester is for the acquisition of a high resolution imaging X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS). It will provide researchers with: (1) a highly sensitive quantitative tool to measure elemental composition, and chemical and electronic states of diverse inorganic and organic thin films and solids: and, (2) provide an imaging capability of chemical patterns and structured films with sub 3 nm lateral resolution. It will offer highly accurate and non-destructive characterization of inorganic semiconductors and insulators, organic and polymeric thin films, bio-inorganic interfaces, organic self-assembled monolayers, multilayered thin film devices and air/moisture sensitive samples. The XPS instrument will enable such multidisciplinary research projects as: (1) investigation of thermodynamic parameters of immobilized ligand-substrate pairs; (2) XPS and Ultraviolet Photoemission Spectroscopy (UPS) study of the model organic photovoltaic interfaces; (3) surface characterization of semiconductor quantum dots; and, (4) science and preservation of Daguerreotypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shared access to the instrument will be based on the successful model currently employed by the University of Rochester's Nano facility, and it will find immediate use by researchers in the departments of Chemical, Mechanical, and Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry, Optics, Physics, Computer Science, Materials Science, and the Medical Center. The shared XPS facility will also facilitate collaborations between Rochester University and surrounding academic institutions and industries. One of the critical parameters of the new instrument is fully automatic operation, which can analyze multiple samples. This will permit the 24/7 use of the instrument and will facilitate analysis of samples from research institutions outside of the greater Rochester area. The instrument will significantly impact the University's undergraduate and graduate research programs. Three courses will be modified to help students interested in Engineering, Physics, and Materials Science learn about advanced characterization technique and give them a hand-on experience with XPS and other analytical and imaging tools.</AbstractNarration>
