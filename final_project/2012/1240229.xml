    <AbstractNarration>Bivalve larvae are notoriously difficult and time-consuming to identify to species level, and a method for rapid and accurate identification would enable an entire class of new ecological field studies of bivalve recruitment processes. Raman spectroscopy uses a focused laser beam to measure the calcium carbonate and organic pigment molecules in bivalve shells and potentially allows identification of species based on the composition of the valves. Using single wavelength Raman spectroscopy, the PIs were able to distinguish Eastern oyster larvae from six other bivalve species with 100% accuracy, while three other species had identification accuracies greater than 80%. The PIs propose to purchase a 3-wavelength confocal Raman Microscope to improve discrimination and test the efficacy of Raman spectroscopy for widespread application in bivalve larval identification. They will collect and analyze Raman spectra on larvae of 20 bivalve species to determine if reliable species-specific differences exist, and will explore methods to improve analysis of spectral results. The investigators plan to create an open database of spectral data from their studies, will offer a workshop on their methods, and will make the equipment available to the community under specified conditions for use.</AbstractNarration>
