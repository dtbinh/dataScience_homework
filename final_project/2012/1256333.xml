    <AbstractNarration>This project is documenting the extent of evidence-based STEM instructional practices on the Arizona State University Polytechnic campus and assessing and enhancing their impact. Evidence-based practices are based on research in learning and teaching. They yield objective evidence of improved student learning in actual classroom situations. They typically incorporate classroom or laboratory activities that require students to express their thinking though actions that go beyond copying notes or executing prescribed procedures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is: (1) collecting and examining course syllabi and instructional materials to determine whether and to what degree they incorporate evidence-based instructional practices; (2) using standard protocols to carry out observations of selected classes and laboratories to assess implementation of evidence-based instructional practices; (3) assessing student learning in STEM courses, allowing measurement of the effectiveness of future course reforms; and (4) working with instructors to facilitate and enhance the adoption and use of evidence-based instructional practices in their STEM classes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is using state-of-the-art, research-based assessment instruments in diverse STEM fields for gauging student learning and monitoring the effects of reformed instructional practice. It is a key step in the process of increasing effectiveness of STEM instruction through evidence-based practice at Arizona State University, which has the largest student enrollment in the nation. Successful implementation and dissemination of this model of enhancing evidence-based instructional practice will provide both an incentive and a roadmap for other educational institutions that wish to take effective action to improve STEM learning for their students.</AbstractNarration>
