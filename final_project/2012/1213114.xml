    <AbstractNarration>This award is towards support of a Chapman Conference on Volcanism and the Atmosphere, to be held June 11-15, 2012 at Selfoss Iceland. It is now well-established that volcanic eruptions can have a significant effect on the Earth's atmosphere and global and regional climate. Larger eruptions in the distant past may have caused major changes in global and regional climate, and possibly changes in human populations. In order to detect modern anthropogenic influences on climate, including effects of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and ozone-depleting chemicals, and to evaluate proposals for stratospheric geoengineering, it is crucial to quantify natural fluctuations such as volcanic eruptions so as to separate them from other natural and anthropogenic factors in the climate record. Since the Chapman Conference on Volcanism and the Earth's Atmosphere a decade or so ago, there have been advances in our understanding of volcanism and its effects on the atmosphere. The vulnerability of the aviation industry to volcanic eruptions has also received attention in recent years. The conference will bring together experts to examine issues such as mechanisms of super-eruptions and climatic effects as evidenced in model simulations; high-resolution Holocene records of explosive eruptions; volcanism in the last millennium; improved proxy records such as ice-cores; climatic response to high-latitude eruptions; geoengineering using stratospheric aerosols and volcanic eruptions and aviation. A review article will be written for dissemination to a wider audience.</AbstractNarration>
