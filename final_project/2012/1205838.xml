    <AbstractNarration>Investigation of molecular phenomena at cold and ultracold temperatures has become a major area of research in atomic, molecular and optical physics in recent years. This award supports theoretical investigations of a variety of atom-diatom chemical reactions and molecule-molecule collisions at cold and ultracold temperatures. Barrierless chemical reactions involving alkali metal and non-alkali metal atom systems as well as tunneling dominated reactions will be investigated. The research will shed insights into novel energy transfer mechanisms in molecular collisions in the extreme quantum limit and explore how van der Waals interaction potentials in the reactant/product channels may influence reactivity at ultralow temperatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will provide improved understanding of chemical reactivity at temperatures close to absolute zero and may reveal new pathways for control of chemical reaction dynamics. Computational algorithms developed during the course of this research could also be applied to describe molecular processes in diverse environments ranging from ultracold molecules to atmospheric chemistry as well as astrophysics and plasma fusion reactors. Research performed with this award will also contribute to future workforce development in Science and Technology at a time when the overall interest in Science and Engineering is on the decline in the United States.</AbstractNarration>
