    <AbstractNarration>The Mathematics REU at UConn will involve a small group of students, approximately 9 per year, in research on problems from several active areas of mathematics and mathematics education. In pure mathematics typical projects will involve using computational tools or hands-on combinatorial arguments to investigate properties of basic examples that are expected to illuminate some larger part of the theory. Specific projects will vary from year to year, and may include problems from algebraic geometry, stochastic processes, analysis on fractals and disordered spaces, and exotic metric geometries. The projects in mathematics education will vary depending on student interest; specific topics that are available include research on key questions about the content-knowledge needed for effective teaching and how it can be translated into effective pedagogy, and methods for evaluating the use of instructional technology in large classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the REU is to contribute to the development of human resources in mathematics and mathematics education by engaging a diverse group of undergraduates from primarily non-PhD granting institutions in research that yields publishable results, produces conference talks and posters, and encourages the students to pursue graduate studies and careers in mathematics and mathematics education. In addition to research experience the program will give students practice in writing and presenting their work, teach them how to use software for mathematics (e.g. Mathematica, Matlab) and for writing mathematics (LATEX), expose them to a broad range of mathematical topics through a weekly seminar series, and include workshops on how to apply to graduate school and the ethics of scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
