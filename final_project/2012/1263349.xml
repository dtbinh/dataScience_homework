    <AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Oregon State University (OSU). The program will provide 20 students with a 10-week active learning experience each summer for five years, for a total of 100 students over the duration of the program. Each summer, ten interns will work with scientists from the Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC) in Newport, Oregon, and ten interns will work at the OSU main campus in Corvallis with mentors from the College of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS). The major field for this REU site is broadly defined as marine science, ranging from marine and estuarine biology and ecology (at HMSC) through the physical sciences (marine aspects of physics, geology, and climate at CEOAS) to provide a diverse range of undergraduate research opportunities and faculty mentors. The major objectives of the REU program are to i) provide students with the opportunity to experience research in marine science and an understanding of its interdisciplinary nature; ii) provide students with a unique educational opportunity and exposure to a wide range of marine science; and iii) increase participation in and access to marine science for under-represented groups and students lacking access to STEM research. Interns have directed research projects, a required report and oral presentation, and are encouraged to present at regional or national meetings. Additional activities include seminars, fieldwork, interaction with graduate students and related intern programs, career development training, scientific ethics discussions, and exchanges to learn about other interdisciplinary research conducted in Oregon's diverse environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
