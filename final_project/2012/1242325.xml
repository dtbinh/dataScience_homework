    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to infuse sustainability concepts into three civil engineering courses using experiential learning. The project is involving students in research-quality and service learning experiences and in engaging laboratory activities both in the classroom and in the real-world. In addition, it is reaching middle school and high school students and teachers and residents in low income communities through ongoing programs The evaluation effort, with assistance from an on-campus center for instructional development, is using on-line student and faculty surveys, analysis of student products, and direct observations to monitor progress. Dissemination is being accomplished through postings on websites and through conference and journal publications. Broader impacts include the dissemination of the material, the K-12 outreach, and the interaction with the community through the service learning component.</AbstractNarration>
