    <AbstractNarration>In this project the Principal Investigator will use a combined experimental and theoretical approach to understand the role of risk-sensitivity in movement adaptation. Movements will be analyzed within a decision-theoretic framework. The central hypothesis is that risk-sensitivity is a fundamental determinant of movement adaptation. Young and older adults will perform whole-body movement tasks that involve adaptation to novel reaching dynamics under increasing conditions of risk. Risk will be modulated by altering the subjective value associated with a given movement error. Risk-sensitivity will be quantified based on the relationship between movement error and movement-to-movement adaptation. Older adults are an ideal population to test model predictions because the subjective value of an error is greater. They have a reduced capacity to produce rapid corrections when an error elicits an unwanted action and have a greater prevalence of injurious falls. Together, these studies will determine whether risk-sensitivity provides a mechanistic explanation for the effect of the subjective value of movement error on adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, this research will test the idea that risk influences movement adaptation. It articulates a conceptual framework that could potentially transform current analyses of the decision-making processes underlying movement adaptation. The proposed work will develop a decision-theoretic, risk-sensitive model of movement adaptation that can be broadly used in the field of motor control to investigate learning in a range of movements and movement contexts, to inform studies on the generalization of risk-sensitive behavior to non-motor tasks, and how this behavior changes across the lifespan. It can inspire future studies that leverage risk-sensitivity to facilitate adaptation, and significantly advance the state-of-the-art in the areas of sensorimotor control, rehabilitation, and decision making.</AbstractNarration>
