    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Christopher Paget of the University of South Carolina to conduct a research project, entitled "A comparison of microbial degradation and plant uptake in removing aquatic pharmaceutical contaminants," during the summer of 2012 at the University of Tokushima in Tokushima, Tokushima Prefecture, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Hiroshi Yamamoto.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project includes addressing limited knowledge from recent research, particularly in regards to the behavior of microbial biofilms in aquatic bioremediation, and how this compares to phytoremediation by active plant uptake using common duckweed. Despite a lack of established toxicity thresholds of aquatic pharmaceutical contaminants, concerns exist about long-term effects. There is limited knowledge about how biodegradation may affect removal of a wide range of compounds, how it works together with phytoremediation, and how these processes may work to more efficiently remove contaminants than conventional wastewater treatment. To address this, this project uses several classes of pharmaceuticals to compare how phytoremediation and biodegradation work separately and in succession. Additionally, studies have addressed the need for low-cost, low-impact, sustainable methods, and these processes will play a role in these alternative technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
