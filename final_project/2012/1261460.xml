    <AbstractNarration>Speech rhythm, the patterns of varying pitch, loudness and tempo in spoken language, plays a major role in language acquisition and comprehension. For example, sensitivity to speech rhythm during early childhood has been found to be a predictor of acquisition of good reading skills and introducing rhythmic regularity can help when speech comprehension or production is disrupted. Yet it remains unclear whether and how rhythmic regularity affects reading. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Cyrille Magne, Ph.D., of Middle Tennessee State University, will investigate how linguistic rhythm affects the processing of both structure and meaning of written sentences in English. Dr. Magne will use electrophysiological methods to measure how linguistic rhythm influences brain activity during reading. Dr. Magne expects to answer the question whether rhythmic information is actively used to constrain reading and whether a regular rhythm may be used as a mean to facilitate reading comprehension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge obtained from this research has the potential to have far-reaching impacts on both educational and clinical applications. Specifically, the findings may be of crucial importance for researchers attempting to use neural markers to support the development of new methods for reading assessment, progress monitoring, and intervention. The experimental findings may lead to discovery of biological markers useful in the study of reading disorders such as dyslexia. Furthermore, this project also offers a unique opportunity for school practitioners, currently enrolled in the Ph.D. program in Literacy Studies at Middle Tennessee State University, to conduct research using cognitive neuroscience tools. Finally, Dr. Magne will participate in the big data sharing effort by making the data available to support other coordinated NSF efforts that aim to make use of real data in the teaching of STEM-related courses and to enable participation in discovery science by those who would otherwise have no access to such data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is cofunded by the Office of Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).</AbstractNarration>
