    <AbstractNarration>Researchers plan to further investigate and develop the potential market viability of Symbolic Virtual Device (SVD) and Hardware Design as Virtual Device (HD-VD) technologies. Both SVD and HD-VD enable device driver development and validation before real devices or their hardware prototypes become available. Through this project, research plans to study the formal hypothesis-validation approach to access the potential and market readiness of these technologies and to mitigate gaps between academic research and public use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SVD and HD-VD technologies have the potential to significantly reduce the time-to-market of devices and their drivers while improving their quality. They can help truly realize the "shift left" paradigm in the device and driver co-development: driver development starts early and driver code is largely ready when the device becomes available. Design and validation products based on these technologies are expected to influence design of semiconductors as well as systems and software products.</AbstractNarration>
