    <AbstractNarration>This RAPID project will produce, pilot and evaluate a prototype exemplar, an innovative web-based platform designed to help teachers better understand the incorporation of practices into the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The NRC produced a framework for the NGSS and the first draft of the NGSS has been released for public comment. The project is an appropriate RAPID as twenty-six states have now signed on as lead states to implement these standards when the final version is released in January 2013. States, districts and schools are anxious for materials that help them think about implementing these new standards. The standards represent a significant departure from current practice in K-12 science education. The rapid prototyping exemplar proposed here will help school leaders and teachers better understand what alignment with these standards looks like through the repurposing of existing classroom videos that incorporate the use of modeling practices and effective argumentation into K-12 science content.</AbstractNarration>
