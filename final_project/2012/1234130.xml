    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to study, a new class of nanocomposite materials termed covetics, and compare their behavior to their respective base materials. The nanocomposites consist of a metal matrix and carbon nanofillers which are combined with metal in a new way. The carbon-metal bond is strong and the carbon does not separate out during remelting, laser ablasion or magnetron sputtering. Preliminary results have shown that these materials exhibit some unique structural features and deformation behaviors not seen in traditional metals, and have superior properties to the base metals. However, fundamental knowledge of these materials is lacking. The proposed university-industry collaborative project between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Third Millennium Metals, LLC will address the multi-scale experimental study of the structure and composition, and mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of these materials. These will serve as inputs and validation for multi-scale modeling of these newly discovered materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, these studies would lead to a fundamental understanding of these new materials, would stimulate further research on covetics, and facilitate a transition from scientific discovery to commercialization and applications including energy, thermal management, transportation, and environment. The proposed research may potentially lead to new discoveries regarding material structure, bonding, and/or new deformation mechanisms. The knowledge gained would lead to more accurate predictions of properties of nanocomposites, new materials? designs, and more reliable structures, in general. The educational plan focuses on course development and incorporation of findings of this research into existing courses on materials. The results will be published and course notes will be posted on the NSF NanoHub website.</AbstractNarration>
