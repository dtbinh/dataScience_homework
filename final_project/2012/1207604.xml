    <AbstractNarration>The second annual meeting of the Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) is to be held at the University of Iowa on April 13-15, 2012. The project was proposed by a group of underrepresented students in the University of Iowa Mathematics Department and is largely run and organized by graduate students. Speakers will give 30-minute research talks in various subfields of topology and algebra; these subfields include algebraic combinatorics, enumerative geometry, knot theory, and representation theory. One distinguished graduate student will give an hour long presentation and one invited faculty member, Dr. Federico Ardila of San Francisco State University and Universidad de Los Andes, will give a one hour keynote address. Undergraduate participants from the VIGRE/ALLIANCE Summer REU will also present in a poster session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USTARS promotes diversity within the mathematical community by providing a platform for collaboration and professional development. Participants are exposed to a variety of current research, ideas, and results, and meet underrepresented professors and students who will become future collaborators or colleagues. The conference also promotes diversity by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. Indeed, the conference organizing committee is diverse in gender, ethnicity, and educational background, and hence is well-positioned to encourage participation from a diverse group of students. The participants of the conference will continue to influence the next generation of students by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.mathalliance.org/ustars.asp</AbstractNarration>
