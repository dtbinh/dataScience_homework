    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division Professor Hong Yan of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will develop new heterogeneous, metallic catalysts as well as fundamental understanding of the structural origins of their high performance in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and in chemical conversion of major by-products from biomass. Specifics aims are: 1) study of the preparation and fine nanostructures of M@Pt (core@shell) particle-on-particle heterogeneous nanostructures; 2) study of the structure and catalytic property relationship of M@Pt or M@PtM catalysts in ORR; 3) design, synthesis and ORR catalytic property of faceted heterogeneous Pt multimetallic nanocrystal catalysts; and 4) thermal chemical conversion of glycerol using on Pt-based core-shell heterogeneous catalysts. Preparation, atomic level characterization and structure-catalytic property relation of core-shell, heterogeneous nanostructures will be examined. Effect of particular structural issues such as facet and surface distortion on catalytic performance will be carefully studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New production technologies using alternative energy sources, including hydrogen and biofuel, heavily depend on the development of new generation of advanced catalysts to facilitate and accelerate reactions using less energy than conventional systems. This project will directly address this technological challenge through the design and understanding of new bimetallic nanostructures. It will also serve as a training platform for students at all levels and with different social, economic backgrounds to become able scientists to carry out life-long research in the utilization of new sustainable energy sources. The knowledge gained during this work will be rapidly disseminated through scientific publications, conference presentations and web-based media.</AbstractNarration>
