    <AbstractNarration>This project, developing an instrument for near-real-time high-accuracy musculoskeletal system analysis named SKELETALMI, aims to enable timely and accurate measurement, analysis, and characterization of in vivo combined joint movement, whole body kinematics, skeletal muscle activity, and body reaction forces. The instrument consist of hardware components that include devices for fluoroscopic X-ray image acquisition, for measuring whole body movement, for skeletal muscle activity, for measuring lower and upper body reaction forces, and a high performance computer system; as well as software to analyze and characterize jointly in vivo joint kinematics, joint kinetics, and muscle activation.&lt;br/&gt;SKELETALMI is expected to &lt;br/&gt;- Allow real-time calibration through overlay between fluoroscopic images and optical images;&lt;br/&gt;- Automatically reconstruct 3D bone models from CT and MRI scans in real-time;&lt;br/&gt;- Automatically estimate 3D in vivo bone movement through 2D/3D registration; &lt;br/&gt;- Automatically establish 3D bone coordinated systems and convert the 3D in vivo movement into 3D joint kinematics;&lt;br/&gt;- Fuse the accurate joint kinematics, whole body kinematics, muscle activation, and body reaction forces and visualize all the information on digital human models.&lt;br/&gt;This development has a strong multidisciplinary component that involves algorithms, biomechanics, biomedical imaging, HCI, and computer graphics. The project constitutes a joint collaborative effort of Rutgers with the State University of NJ and Kessler Foundation Research Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation impacts many application domains such as shoe design, athletic training, injury prevention, aging, design of movement-related medical device, and surgical/rehabilitation technique innovation. Underpinned by the capabilities of the instrument and the new related data collected, new courses will be developed in musculoskeletal biomechanics, graphics simulation, movement analysis, and biomedical image analysis. Consequently, the instrument also influences the educational programs at the institution that should generate graduates with a comprehensive knowledge of computational sciences, medical science, and product design.</AbstractNarration>
