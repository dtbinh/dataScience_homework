    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Programs Professor Karin Ruhlandt-Senge from Syracuse University and colleague Philip Borer will acquire a highly automated 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with a liquid-nitrogen cooled probe. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) reactivity, weak interactions, and aggregation in highly reactive metal species; (b) development of polysaccharide-based carriers for targeted drug delivery; (c) nucleic acid switches; (d) inhibitors of SHIP-phosphatase; (e) chiral catalysts for use in complex molecule synthesis; (f) role of metal ions in biology and medicine; (g) bioactive peptides and peptide sensors; (h) unnatural molecules with unique folds; (i) dynamic ligand exchange at quantum dot interfaces; (j) carbon-carbon bond forming reaction of 2-methylenetetrahydropyrans; and (k) technetium and rhenium-based radiopharmaceuticals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. Many research projects associated with this application will have a direct impact on society, as they aim to develop biomimetic polymerization initiators, sensors, conducting materials, and new drugs or treatments, vaccines, amongst others. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research at Syracuse University and also at neighboring institutions.</AbstractNarration>
