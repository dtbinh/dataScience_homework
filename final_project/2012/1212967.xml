    <AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program of the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science Foundation supports the work of Professor Sunghee Lee at Iona College, concerning how supramolecular aggregates direct the crystallization of substances at a liquid-liquid interface. The research includes: (1) investigating the effect of surfactant monolayer structure upon crystallization by employing polymorphic organic crystal systems as reporters for subtle changes in monolayer structure; (2) studying the mechanism by which lipid bilayers in mesophases promote the crystallization of important protein targets through establishment of the droplet interface bilayer as a model; and (3) determining the nature and extent of interaction of ions with bilayers using the droplet interface bilayer model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will enhance the body of empirical and systematic knowledge regarding arrangement of molecules which preferentially reside at the liquid-liquid interface. The understanding of molecular assemblies at the liquid-liquid interface will be an important contribution to fields which rely on these structures, such as biomimetic materials synthesis, electronics, diagnostics, drug delivery, and the plastic and pharmaceutical industries. Undergraduate students will perform research, co-author the relevant publications, and present their findings at national meetings. Thus, the research will impact the future career pathways in science available to numerous undergraduates, through enhanced availability and depth of research training at Iona College, a predominantly undergraduate institution.</AbstractNarration>
