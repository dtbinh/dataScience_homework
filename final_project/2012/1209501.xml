    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Kimberlee Marcellus of Drexel University to conduct a research project, entitled "Applying GIS to manage construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste distribution in urban environments," during the summer of 2012 at Nagoya University in Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi. The host scientist is Dr. Hiroki Tanikawa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research is to advance a successful tracking system to provide a uniform methodology to disclose C&amp;D waste flows and synthesize new and existing data to develop a centralized approach with a geospatial component while answering the question: where do these waste flows occur the most and in what time frame are they expected to enter secondary markets? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
