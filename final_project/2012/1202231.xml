    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Objectives and Approaches - The objective of this research is to advance the solution processed hybrid triple-junction photovoltaic technology to 15% efficiency. The approaches are comprehensive and include: design of organic donor and acceptor materials with high efficiency and spectrum-matched absorption; a solution processed inorganic solar cell to cover the near-IR spectrum; novel interlayer and hybrid tandem solar cells; and novel transparent electrodes to realize all solution processed hybrid tandem solar cells. 15% efficiency will be a milestone for low-cost high efficiency solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit - Renewable energy is crucial for sustainable economic development and environmental protection. The proposed research represents a new front in solar cell research and integrates both chemistry and materials science to generate new perspectives in science and offer solutions to challenging sustainable energy issues. We aim to contribute to our national energy security and a greener economy by achieving a breakthrough in solution processed high efficiency solar cells. This project will not only give us device success, but enrich our understanding of fundamental physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts - The proposed research will impact the national and global effort in developing new sustainable energy strategies and technologies, thus impact our nation?s economy and improve environmental quality by reducing the use of fossil fuels. This project offers students (from high school to graduate-level) the opportunity to learn the skills to face future scientific challenges. The team has strong partnerships with the private sector through patent licensing, which will continue and greatly benefit the US economy.</AbstractNarration>
