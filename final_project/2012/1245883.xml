    <AbstractNarration>Flood modeling and management are crucial areas in sustainable infrastructure planning and disaster mitigation. Thus is it critical that civil engineering students become familiar with advanced flood visualization and decision-making tools so that they may adequately design sustainable infrastructure for the future. In this project, Purdue University Calumet is developing laboratory modules using three-dimensional (3-D) simulation models to allow students to interactively explore different flood management scenarios based on real-world data. The modules are implemented in undergraduate water resources engineering courses in partnership with the University of the District of Columbia, Florida Atlantic University, and the University of Kentucky. Through the 3-D laboratory modules, students are using the simulated flooding scenarios to visualize the field implications and to evaluate flood mitigation options. The laboratory modules are being evaluated on their effectiveness in aiding students' attainment of specific content-based learning objectives and impact on students' learning process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is significant because it incorporates an immersive virtual 3-D environment for students, as well as practitioners and decision makers, to interactively explore flood scenarios and to identify appropriate flood management plans. This approach integrates traditional flood modeling tools and innovative geospatial approaches, combined with advanced 3-D computational, animation, and visualization techniques to enhance student learning. Through workshops, presentations, and publications, the modules are being shared with faculty at other institutions, community groups responsible for flood management, and the scientific community more broadly.</AbstractNarration>
