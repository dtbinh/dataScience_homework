    <AbstractNarration>The activities described in this proposal will serve to advance the field of spinal orthotics through the further development and eventual commercialization of a thoracopelvic orthosis that reduces the muscle effort required to maintain flexed postures of the trunk. The device at the heart of this proposal is a novel thoracopelvic orthosis which incorporates a closed-loop control system to drive an electromechanical support structure that allows for the wearer to remain supported in a variety of postures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The continued development of this thoracopelvic orthosis will integrate knowledge from both biomechanics and robotics, and will expand the research and development of powered exoskeletons (a.k.a. "wearable robots") to include accurate following of spinal motion (cervical and lumbar, especially). The orthosis will initially be developed as a form of ergonomic support for surgeons and other highly-trained professionals that could reduce lost productivity and medical costs of this population. Eventually, the novel functionality of this orthosis could enhance general patient care through the creation of a new mode of orthotic treatment that serves as a "bridge therapy" between current orthotic treatment physical therapy; as the patient heals, a remote clinician could wirelessly reprogram the orthosis mechanical response (range of motion, mechanical stiffness/damping) that gradually reintroduces motion while lowering support, thus leaving the patient with a more normal level of spinal mobility and reduced need for further physical therapy.</AbstractNarration>
