    <AbstractNarration>The Noyce STEM Teacher Education in the Arkansas Delta (N-STEAD) project is a Phase I effort to recruit and prepare a minimum of nineteen science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors to teach in high-needs secondary schools (grades 7-12) in the Arkansas Delta region. An internship component focuses on providing first- and second-year STEM majors the opportunity to teach within an informal STEM context. Students gain an early experience in science education through planning lessons, presenting science to children, and assessing the outcomes through participation in a science outreach program known locally as "Ridin' Dirty with Science," a cooperative venture between Hendrix College and the Boys and Girls Club of Faulkner County. For juniors and seniors a scholarship component supports STEM majors who are pursuing the completion of licensure requirements for secondary life/earth science, physical/earth science, or mathematics certification. Scholarship recipients participate in an education apprenticeship in a high-needs area, complete eight of their twelve-week student teaching experience in a cooperating Delta region school district, and then teach two years in a high-needs school in the region. A two-year induction program is also a part of their initial teaching experience upon graduation and provides on-site assessments and offers tailored assistance in content, pedagogy, and Delta culture from Hendrix College STEM and Education faculty, and Delta-based master teachers. Membership in either NSTA or NCTM is also provided for these novice teachers to support their enculturation into the profession.</AbstractNarration>
