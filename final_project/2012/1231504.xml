    <AbstractNarration>Objective: &lt;br/&gt;Spectrum sensing is the most important element of cognitive radio, as it forms the ba-&lt;br/&gt;sis for adaptive spectrum sharing. Wideband spectrum sensing without frequency sweeping or&lt;br/&gt;Nyquist-rate sampling is a challenging problem, especially for network sensing from low-end sen-&lt;br/&gt;sors with limited communication capabilities. Assume that each sensor can only down-convert,&lt;br/&gt;filter, and send out a binary signal when it measures energy above threshold at its filter?s output.&lt;br/&gt;Is it possible to form a satisfactory estimate of the ambient power spectrum using just a few such&lt;br/&gt;bits? This is the question at the core of this project, and exciting preliminary results suggest that&lt;br/&gt;the answer is on the affirmative. A well-rounded research program has been designed to build&lt;br/&gt;upon these preliminary findings. The research will evolve along four thrusts: i) core system design&lt;br/&gt;and performance analysis; ii) distributed implementation; iii) relevant extensions, such as adaptive&lt;br/&gt;sensing; and iv) software radio experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;Power spectrum estimation from few wideband energy detection bits has never&lt;br/&gt;been considered - yet is a fundamental extension of spectral analysis. Exciting new applications&lt;br/&gt;of convex optimization theory and methods will be found in the area of network-based spectrum&lt;br/&gt;estimation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;Wideband spectrum sensing using cheap sensors and few bits is a transformative&lt;br/&gt;idea that has the potential to permeate the benefits of cognitive radio down to commodity hardware&lt;br/&gt;- something currently far from reality. The topic is highly conducive for involving students and&lt;br/&gt;training the next generation of wireless engineers.</AbstractNarration>
