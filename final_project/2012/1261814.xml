    <AbstractNarration>The goals of this project are first, to examine the role of secondary education as a mediator of globalizing cultural change in subjective and objective outcomes for the demographic shift cohort in a rapidly changing socio-cultural and economic context; and second, to inform theory, policy, and practice regarding the mushrooming global health concern of adolescent well-being. To accomplish these goals this research will extend a longitudinal study of a key cohort of young women's experiences of cultural and economic change to examine and explain important outcomes in their lives. In doing so, this research will provide experience-near data on processes of globalization as mediated by education. It will also assess and report on outcomes in relation to both local and global indicators of adolescent well-being including identification of points for policy and practice interventions. Through a mixed-methods ethnographic approach using interviews, surveys, and archival research, this study utilizes a unique opportunity to track iterative processes of individuals within their changing cultural context over time in order to explain (i.e. not simply describe) significant outcomes in their lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to advance theory on subjective processes involved in globalization for young people with a focus on intracultural variation, education, and subjective experience. Specifically, this study applies a human development perspective to youth-related globalization theories to articulate the iterative processes of personal meaning making and rapid cultural and institutional change. It will explain how individuals in a critical historical moment of cultural change have made sense of socio-cultural, institutional, and economic change and employed educational experience to selectively craft new pathways in their own lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has broad impacts on policy and practice regarding growing global concerns related to adolescent well-being, and it impacts methodological expansion of ethnographic techniques in longitudinal cultural anthropology studies. Results will point to key arenas and sensitive periods for evaluating institutional interventions to promote general well-being for youth undergoing rapid cultural change and contribute a rare person-centered ethnographic model of a panel study in cultural anthropology while training graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
