    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a low cost&lt;br/&gt;and durable ice-release coating to mitigate icing-related problems encountered by air&lt;br/&gt;transportation, power transmission, wind energy industries, and appliances such as&lt;br/&gt;refrigerators, freezers and air conditioners. Current de-icing products include&lt;br/&gt;environmentally problematic de-icing fluids, energy inefficient electrical heating, and&lt;br/&gt;deicing coatings with high cost but poor mechanical toughness. The proposed coating is&lt;br/&gt;based on (1) a recent fundamental study that revealed a heretofore unrecognized&lt;br/&gt;combination of critical parameters controlling ice adhesion, (2) a novel hybrid coating&lt;br/&gt;model that includes nanoscale and mesoscale contributions to weakening ice adhesion,&lt;br/&gt;and (3) a ?soft surface / tough bulk? coating that utilizes strong mechanical properties of&lt;br/&gt;a conventional, low cost polymer and a low surface energy polymer modifier. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed coating product will reduce costs and mitigate damage to energy,&lt;br/&gt;communication and transportation industries as well as reducing maintenance on&lt;br/&gt;refrigeration appliances. ?Green chemical engineering? is targeted for minimum VOC&lt;br/&gt;and short chain fluorocarbon constituents that are environmentally benign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project include (i) de-icing&lt;br/&gt;applications in ground and ocean transportation, such as easy ice release for automobiles&lt;br/&gt;and ships, and in housing to prevent ice accumulation, for example on roofs; (ii) easy&lt;br/&gt;release of hard fouling for ships and ocean platforms;. Potential customers include&lt;br/&gt;Department of Defense for US Air Force and Navy, transportation and energy industries,&lt;br/&gt;and the petroleum industry.</AbstractNarration>
