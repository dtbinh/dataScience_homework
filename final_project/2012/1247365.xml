    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for a satellite workshop to the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), to be held in Dallas, TX on August 4-9, 2013. The goal of the workshop is to explore subfields in cognitive science that hold the most promise for increasing our understanding of neural networks and computational intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IJCNN explores the theoretical and computational understanding of the brain in order to develop new and more effective forms of machine intelligence. Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and mental processes. The workshop is intended to foster more effective integration between the two communities. The workshop will provide a venue in which neural network researchers and students can learn more about the state of the art in cognitive science and its interface with computational intelligence. The broader impacts of the workshop include fostering new collaborations between neural network researchers and those working in other areas of cognitive science. In addition, it provides for reduced registration for women and other scientists underrepresented in the field.</AbstractNarration>
