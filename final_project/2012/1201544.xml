    <AbstractNarration>This conference will take place January 23-27, 2012 in Miami. The conference webpage is at http://www.math.berkeley.edu/~auroux/miami2012.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kontsevich's formulation of Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS) and its subsequent extension to more general settings involve algebraic and geometric tools such as Lagrangian intersection theory, some new derived categories, or noncommutative Hodge structures. Recently, Homological Mirror Symmetry has transformed from a phantasy to a leading field in modern geometry. This was achieved in part due to constant exchange of information among the leaders of the field of Homological Mirror Symmetry (Kontsevich, Soibelman, Orlov, Auroux , Abouzaid, Fukaya, Seidel, Zaslow, Pantev, Gross, Siebert, Mikhalkin, Zharkov, Thomas, Smith, Katzarkov, Bridgeland, Frenkel, Okounkov, Bezrukavnikov, Bridgeland, Pandharipande)with physicists (Vafa, Hori, Gukov, Kapustin, Neitzke, Douglas, Diaconescu). This exchange was mainly done during month-long activities taking place every winter in Miami. In addition, many young people were attracted to this field: Sheridan, Preigel, Izik, Pandit, Favero, Kerr, Ballard, Diemer, Dykerhoff. This conference will enable these fruitful exchanges to continue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While mirror symmetry initially arose from phenomena in string theory, this very active subject at the interface between mathematics and physics has acquired increasing mathematical stature. Numerous works have shown the relevance to mirror symmetry of new and subtle mathematical structures. This conference will extend the success of previous activities by branching out in a new field of dissemination - creating a new University of Miami, Cinvestav, Campinas institute featuring two conferences per year and exchange of postdocs and students. These conferences will be happening in winter and will be partially supported by University of Miami, Cinvestav, and Campinas.</AbstractNarration>
