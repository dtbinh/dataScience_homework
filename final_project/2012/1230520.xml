    <AbstractNarration>The proposed work seeks to apply data analytics to the software development process. An analytic is typically data analysis that changes the behavior of an organization. Application of data analytics to software engineering is relatively new and limited. The proposed research plans to use five significant software technologies, each of which has been shown to have a positive impact on the software process and product, to identify and quantify software development patterns whose analysis will be used to better understand and improve the software development process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the proposed work have the potential for significant impact the software design and engineering process. The resulting analytics have the potential to greatly improve the ability to assess quality, predict reliability, diagnose problems, discern impending faults and identify maintenance procedures in real time. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the centers portfolio through expansion into the relatively new software analytics area. The center will involve graduate students and undergraduates in the work, publish and incorporate the results in existing coursework software engineering.</AbstractNarration>
