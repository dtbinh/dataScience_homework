    <AbstractNarration>The workshop will bring together Principle Investigators of the leading software cyberinfrastructure projects and discuss issues relevant to the community as we move into the future. In 2011 and 2012 the OCI Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2) program funded software efforts in small development efforts that can provide software pieces that can be integrated into the larger cyberinfrastructure, and larger collaborations that were delivering significant community software. In addition, new SI2 awards aimed at conceptualizing large-scale software institutes, aimed at providing a fabric for the software needed by domain scientists to achieve breakthroughs in their intra and inter-disciplinary efforts, will be awarded. New NSF initiatives such as EarthCube are defining roadmaps for cyberinfrastructure development in Earth sciences. This workshop will bring together the Principle Investigators of the recent SI2 awards to discuss potential synergies and collaborations, define challenges ahead, discuss the relationship of the SI2 efforts to the planned Software Institutes, and explore the relationship of the OCI-funded software in the context of the broad NSF initiatives such as EarthCube, DataWay, and other planned community-focused efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve its goals, the workshop will focus on these main themes: (i) Discussing SI2 projects within the context of SI2 Institutes and NSF-wide initiative such as EarthCube, DataWay, and others; (ii) sharing experiences in building quality software and services; (iii) fostering collaboration and providing incentives for collaboration and cyberinfrastructure development as a career; and (iv) sustaining the software capabilities in the long term, defining software value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will solicit participation from major science and engineering projects that rely on the national cyberinfrastructure for their computations and data management needs. Their participation will help ensure that the cyberinfrastructure software developed as part of SI2 projects will be relevant and broadly applicable to a number of science and engineering domains. The results of this workshop will then potentially guide cyberinfrastructure development and testing in the future.</AbstractNarration>
