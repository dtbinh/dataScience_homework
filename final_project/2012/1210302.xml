    <AbstractNarration>The Clavariaceae is a poorly studied family of mushroom-forming fungi and the earliest evolutionary branch in the order Agaricales, the most diverse group of mushroom-forming fungi in the Agaricomycotina. The family is characterized by a high diversity of morphological and ecological features, including roles as decomposers and plant root symbionts. A robust phylogeny coupled with evolutionary analyses should yield insights into patterns that have led to its high diversity. The products of this research will include a molecular-based phylogeny, with which ecological and trait evolution analyses will be performed. Additionally, identification and description of novel species and a taxonomic revision of the family are planned. The research will also contribute to the first modern floristic treatment of the family in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this research will be presented at professional and amateur scientific meetings. A molecular reference dataset of known species of Clavariaceae will be produced that will aid identification of DNA sequences obtained from soil and other environmental samples. The proposed collaborative effort involves researchers in Europe and Australia and contributions from domestic and international herbaria and amateur naturalists. Several undergraduates will be trained in aspects of molecular biology and mentored in evolutionary biology.</AbstractNarration>
