    <AbstractNarration>We will use a large seismic dataset recorded by a geophysical contractor in Long Beach CA, in 2011, to test several seismic techniques. The dataset consists of 5200 sensors distributed over a 7x10 km area that recorded continuously for up to 6 months. The data will be used to construct detailed micro-zonation maps (maps of anomalous ground shaking potential) based on local earthquakes recorded during the deployment. We also plan to backproject the continuous recordings onto the Newport-Inglewood fault plane, which traverses the region in order to determine the time history of micro-motions that occur on that fault. Furthermore, we will also estimate the shallow velocity structure based on correlations of the data, and search for scattered body waves in order to image the subsurface structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this research is successful it will have an impact on our understanding of earthquake rupture dynamics and on the substantial lateral variations in seismic hazard, and will show the power of a dense seismic network to assess these. The research also has the potential to have a major impact on the oil and gas industry by showing what can be done with a passive survey, and hence possibly eliminate the need for sources in urban areas.</AbstractNarration>
