    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to broaden our understanding of high-energy astrophysical phenomena, such as particle acceleration and radiation emission, in application to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which are among the most energetic events known in the universe. The physical processes involved are closely related and Dr. Medvedev will investigate their connections using first principles of theoretical analysis, dedicated numerical simulation, and comparison with observational data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate and undergraduate students, and outreach via development of an internet resource which will explain to non-experts the ideas and the current status of the physics of collisionless shocks and relevant processes such as radiation emission and particle acceleration in application to gamma-ray bursts.</AbstractNarration>
