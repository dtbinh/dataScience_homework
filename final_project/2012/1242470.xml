    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Allison Oliver proposes to travel from her home institution at the University of California, Davis to &lt;br/&gt;the Woods Hole Research Center from May 13 to May 19, 2012. She will meet with sponsoring scientists Robert M. Holmes and Robert G.M. Spencer, both experienced in the study of arctic rivers, to discuss future research project ideas, outline research objectives, and develop a research proposal. She will also tour facilities to learn what resources, both technical and personal, are available for collecting, processing, analyzing, and describing data and obtain more detailed information on the logistics of working in the Arctic and the field stations currently supported by projects at the Woods Hole Research Center. Having not worked previously in Arctic ecosystems, she believes that interaction with these two seasoned researchers will of great benefit to her as she pursues a career as a researcher investigating the biogeochemistry and ecology of aquatic systems undergoing pervasive change.</AbstractNarration>
