    <AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to acquire a state-of-the-art, high-resolution, hybrid mass spectrometry system and associated peripherals (LC-MSn). The proposed instrumentation represents a strategic expansion of ODU research capabilities in marine ecosystem studies and will provide new critical research tools for a team of faculty, researchers and students. The LC-MSn instrumentation will be used for structural characterization and quantitative analysis of a diverse suite of polar molecules, most of which are biotic in origin and represent living materials and metabolites, including those of emerging environmental and ecological health concerns. A range of interdisciplinary research activities will benefit from the proposed instrumentation, include: elucidating biogeochemical cycling of organic matter in the Arctic Ocean by analysis of molecular organic markers; utilizing environmental proteomics to understand marine nitrogen cycling and geochemical processes; analyzing transformations of organic nitrogen in coastal systems; characterizing organic molecules associated with marine protists; and addressing the roles of dissolved organic ligands in the sorption and bioavailability of trace metals. This new instrumentation will facilitate further development of ongoing and future research projects that require new levels of analytical sophistication for characterization of organic compounds present in marine and estuarine ecosystems and their environmental context. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested instrumentation will help the continued development of infrastructure for research. Graduate students as well as undergraduate students will benefit from this state-of-the-art facility. ODU has an outreach program through the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center which provides excellent opportunities for public outreach. The research derived from the use of the instrument is to be highlighted through the aquarium and public lectures.</AbstractNarration>
