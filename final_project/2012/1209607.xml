    <AbstractNarration>While often studied in isolation, host-parasite interactions are typically embedded within complex communities in which parasite transmission is dependent not just on the host species, but non-host species such as predators. Recent research has focused on the ability of predators to limit the exposure of hosts to their pathogens by controlling population density of hosts and vectors. An additional mechanism by which predators could lower the risk of disease is by directly consuming parasite free-living infective stages. Preliminary evidence suggests that this mechanism may be common in aquatic ecosystems where various predator species consume free-living stages of parasites, including macroparasites such as trematodes. The central goal of this project is to determine how assemblages of predators affect parasitic infection of amphibians in nature, and whether loss of predator species would cause significant changes to disease dynamics. This research extends initial laboratory findings by testing hypotheses of predation on parasites in the field through extensive surveys of aquatic diversity and precise examination of host infection and disease on the landscape level. This research combines mathematical modeling, laboratory experiments, and field surveys linking observations of natural patterns to functional mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since trematodes are common pathogens of humans, domestic animals, and wildlife this study will advance understanding of how loss of biodiversity in general and predators in particular may be a factor in the recent emergence of some diseases. Development of the transmission models, evaluations of aquatic predator community structure in the field, and calculations of disease risk will be of practical application to management of wildlife and human diseases. This project will provide extensive outreach through after school programs for a local elementary school having many students from groups underrepresented in science, and through environmental science programs conducted by Boulder County 4-H. Undergraduate and high school students will be involved in the research and receive mentoring on science careers.</AbstractNarration>
