    <AbstractNarration>This award supports approximately 20 US-based students to attend the 2012 USENIX Security Symposium, the premier forum for advanced professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds to meet and discuss the newest advances in the security of computer systems and networks. Participation in Security 12 and similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers in the field and exposes students to leading work in the field. This award will enable students to participate who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference. Security 12 will be held August 8-10, 2012, in Bellevue, WA. The conference will consist of a three-day technical program, with numerous workshops co-located. The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers, practitioners, system administrators, system programmers, and others interested in the latest advances in the security of computer systems and networks. This cross-disciplinary emphasis makes it well suited as a target for student participation, and this event has always drawn a large number of student attendees. Students receiving assistance will be strongly encouraged to present posters and works in progress as part of the selection process.</AbstractNarration>
