    <AbstractNarration>Under the guidance of Dr. Robert Tykot and in collaboration with the Sino-American archaeology team of Shandong University, Rheta Lanehart will investigate the presence of lipid residues in various types of ceramic vessels from ancient China in order to identify foodstuffs such as protein, grains, and other plants. The goal of the research is to identify different patterns of food consumption across space and time. Based upon the residue results, it will be possible to provide interpretations about social and ritual activities in relation to social change at the site of Liangchengzhen in southeastern Shandong province. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;China is an area long associated with the social importance of food consumption and the investigation of vessels from Liangchengzhen presents a rare opportunity to examine food consumption at a large regional Longshan period (ca. 2600-1900 BC) center. There is limited information about the nature of activities at Longshan period regional centers, although social and ritual activities have been inferred. The Liangchengzhen excavation team uncovered a series of occupation levels containing over 400 pits, numerous house foundations, and several burials. The pits in particular contain large quantities of ceramic vessels, the main source of data for the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will provide a systematic analysis of the residues from a variety of ceramic forms excavated from pits that are promising for evidence of different kinds of social relations, competitive or integrative. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry technique will be employed. Alkane biomarkers, previously identified in a pilot study, will be used to identify food sources in the pottery residues. Interpretations will be made about the nature of consumption activities over time on the basis of vessels deposited in pits that are hypothesized as offering pits and storage or trash pits. In addition, consideration will be given to spatial and chronological variation at the center with respect to the consumption of hypothesized preferred foods (meat, rice). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide a foundation for broader applications of lipid residue research to the interpretation of consumption and will foster international collaboration. Findings from the research will be reported to Chinese authorities and published in professional journals as well as in venues for the general public, both Chinese and American. Presentations of the research will be given while in China and also to undergraduate and graduate students at the University of South Florida and elsewhere. Online access to the research will be available through Open Context and a website created by the researcher.</AbstractNarration>
