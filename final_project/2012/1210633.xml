    <AbstractNarration>1210633&lt;br/&gt;Westmoreland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests support for a two-day workshop to be held at North Carolina State University to create an implementation plan for "Transforming Combustion Research through CI." A small group of people will develop this plan based on findings of a recent National Research Council study (https://download.nap.edu/login.php?record_id=1) and existing cyberinfrastructure as exemplified by primekinetics.org. Day 1 and the pre-workshop preparation will focus on working out proposed strategies and tactics of the plan. Day 2 will be devoted to writing and vetting the specific details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the activity is to advance combustion science through creation of technical and organizational tools for data archiving, curation, and collaboration. Near-term broader impacts are expected to be technological and educational, creating databases and computational tools for individual, scientific-community, and industrial development and evaluation of a wide range of combustion data. This operational model of software, databases, and support staff should be extensible to other data-generating research communities, transforming the progress of science by allowing improved access and interpretation of data. It should be a model for community development of data-management plans, as well.</AbstractNarration>
