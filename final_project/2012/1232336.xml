    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will investigate the effectiveness of several different interventions designed to retain disabled veterans in engineering degree programs. A comparative study that looks at a range of characteristics related to retention in engineering will be done, and the results analyzed using the theoretical frameworks of social cognitive career theory and self-efficacy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arise from the project's ability to inform other efforts aimed at engaging disabled veterans in career retraining, or all veterans in obtaining STEM degrees as well as the potential impact on the STEM workforce. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>
