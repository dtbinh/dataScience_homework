    <AbstractNarration>Professor Bo Zhang of the University of Washington is supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry to introduce and utilize a fluorescence-based analytical method to increase the sensitivity of electrochemical detection. A key concept of this method is to use a fluorogenic reaction to report the kinetics of a conventional electrochemical reaction of interest, e.g., oxidation of dopamine. As such, this method could significantly improve sensitivity in electrochemical detection and enable new capability. This project will focus on developing a more comprehensive understanding of coupled reactions on bipolar microelectrodes and optimizing fluorescence-enabled electrochemical detection to achieve single-molecule sensitivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new analytical strategy could have significant impact on many important fields, such as neurochemistry, environmental analysis, and electrocatalysis. This work will provide excellent training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of electrochemistry, sensing, and fluorescence microscopy. Graduate and undergraduate students, including female students and minority students, will be recruited into this research program. They will be actively involved in numerous training opportunities such as using state-of-the-art analytical instruments, designing new electrochemical experiments and analyzing results, presenting at group meetings and attending national conferences, and publishing in leading journals in this field.</AbstractNarration>
