    <AbstractNarration>A collisionless plasma is a fully ionized gas in which electromagnetic forces are &lt;br/&gt;strong enough to dominate collisional effects. The motion of a high temperature, &lt;br/&gt;low density collisionless plasma is described by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, a &lt;br/&gt;nonlinear system of hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this setting &lt;br/&gt;collisions are neglected while the charge and current densities, which drive the &lt;br/&gt;Maxwell system, are determined in a self-consistent manner from velocity &lt;br/&gt;moments of solutions to the Vlasov equation. The major question to be studied is &lt;br/&gt;this: are there shocks in a collisionless plasma? That is, could a singularity develop &lt;br/&gt;from smoothly prescribed initial values as time progresses? In some cases, such as &lt;br/&gt;in lower dimensional, relativistic formulations (e.g., one space and two velocity &lt;br/&gt;variables), smooth global solutions are known to exist. Another problem to be &lt;br/&gt;investigated concerns the long-time behavior of the charge and current densities &lt;br/&gt;and electromagnetic fields in the system. More specifically, do dispersive effects &lt;br/&gt;in the equations cause these quantities to decay over time, or is there sufficient &lt;br/&gt;interaction so as to sustain their strength even as time tends to infinity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kinetic Theory includes the study of the motion and properties of plasma. Plasmas &lt;br/&gt;are often referred to as the fourth state of matter (after solids, liquids and gases) &lt;br/&gt;and account for 99.99% of all material in the universe. They are of great practical &lt;br/&gt;interest because they are charged gases, and thus serve as excellent conductors of &lt;br/&gt;electricity. As an example, plasma engines have been developed by a number of &lt;br/&gt;space agencies and recently used to power some NASA spacecraft. Additionally, &lt;br/&gt;the use of plasmas through nuclear fusion as a source of clean energy is currently &lt;br/&gt;of immense scientific interest. Notable examples of collisionless plasmas include &lt;br/&gt;the solar wind, the Earth's ionosphere, galactic nebulae, low-density fusion &lt;br/&gt;reactors, and comet tails. A complete understanding of the solar wind would also &lt;br/&gt;be extremely useful, as this natural phenomenon dictates the intensity of "space &lt;br/&gt;weather", which is often responsible for expensive damage to satellites orbiting &lt;br/&gt;the Earth. The motion of a plasma is described by a number of complicated &lt;br/&gt;differential equations dictated by physics. Among the goals of the current project &lt;br/&gt;are to show that these equations possess solutions (under appropriate conditions), &lt;br/&gt;determine their qualitative behavior, and approximate them computationally so &lt;br/&gt;that one can predict behavior in future situations with certainty.</AbstractNarration>
