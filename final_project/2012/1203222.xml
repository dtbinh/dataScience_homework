    <AbstractNarration>The Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH) at the University of Florida, houses the third largest cataloged collection of vertebrate fossils in United States, providing the most complete basis available for study of vertebrate life and evolution in the eastern United States and the circum-Caribbean Basin area over the past 65 million years. Recent acquisition of three major fossil vertebrate collections from this region has outpaced the museum's ability to store, prepare, curate, and digitize these important fossils in a timely manner. This project provides support for these activities allowing for over 50,000 significant vertebrate fossils, including images, to be made available for scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project allows for expansion of the already successful FLMNH web site. Digital images will be featured on an on-line database, in more popular-oriented web pages on fossil species and localities, and will be used to develop on-line fossil identification guides, and to update the still popular web site on fossil horse evolution. Graduate and undergraduate students and post-graduate assistants will be trained in curatorial activities and receive mentoring in scientific research, communication of results to the public, and professional development skills improving their ability and desire to implement broader impact activities as future professionals.</AbstractNarration>
