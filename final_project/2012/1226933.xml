    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award is to explore the hypothesis that a transdisciplinary theory of inventive design can be developed, which will offer a superior methodology for design than presently exists. New design theories, methods, and tools are necessary not only to maintain, but also to improve on national competitiveness. This research will address a hypothesis that a transdisciplinary theory of inventive design can be developed - based on knowledge from cognitive psychology (Humphreys Theory of Phenomenal Consciousness), that will offer a new approach to design. This project has the potential to generate transdisciplinary knowledge that will advance design science by integrating concepts from design science, cognitive psychology, and computer science, with emphasis on Evolutionary Computation and Designing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the outcomes of the project will be to enable a fundamental scientific shift in what design scientists can contribute to the inventive design process, and make positive impacts towards innovation in each of the three domains of knowledge involved (design science, cognitive psycology, and computer science). The development of innovative products and processes is a critical factor in the competition for global market share and the key to modern challenges related to sustainability, environmental protection, safety, economic growth, and climate change. The specific impact on engineering will be to improve the understanding of the inventive design process in the context of the whole-brain concept of designing - design work in which both the left rational and right creative brain hemispheres are engaged. Furthermore, in presenting the model in the computational terms of Evolutionary Designing, a new generation of computer tools for inventive designing will be developed. In cognitive psychology, the research will improve understanding of creative problem solving, which may provide a deeper understanding how fixation in design can be reduced through the proper framing of the entire inventive design process.</AbstractNarration>
