    <AbstractNarration>The increasing numbers of jurisdictions participating in hazard mitigation planning activities has not guaranteed the implementation of mitigation strategies and practices at the local level. While several recent studies suggest a disconnection between mitigation planning and practice, little is known about the actual adoption and usage of mitigation practice by local jurisdictions. The objective of this study is to empirically investigate mitigation policy practices at the local level. The study specifically seeks to: a) Examine the adoption and the implementation of broad-based hazard mitigation policies that can enhance hazard mitigation within local jurisdictions (counties and municipalities) along the Atlantic and Gulf coastal; b) Examine the influence of local capacity and commitment in the adoption and extent of hazard mitigation regulations, policies, and strategies; and c) Focus on the broader socio-political ecology for planning practice by examining the consequences of factors on various jurisdicational mitigation practices and profiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide an assessment of the effectiveness of federal policy designed to improve mitigation, as well as direction for improving such policies through the assessment of factors related to implementation, including the consistency of actions at different jurisdictional levels, as well as the commitment and capacity of local jurisdictions to act. Broad dissemination to both academic and practitioner audiences through the development of a website and publication of best mitigation practices and model ordinances promises the return of the findings to the audiences who may best benefit from them. The findings of this research will have a direct bearing on the content of educational activities, directly influencing the broader planning community.</AbstractNarration>
