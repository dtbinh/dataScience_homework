    <AbstractNarration>We propose to study some known stability properties of the Gibbs measures in several mean-field spin glass models and to develop new stability properties for other models, as well as to explore what kind of information about the Gibbs measures can be deduced from their stability properties. One of the most important objectives in any given model is to understand the asymptotic structure of its Gibbs measure and in a number of models this structure is expected to be described by a version of the Parisi ultrametric Ansatz. For diluted models, such as diluted p-sat and p-spin models, the proposal concerns with a better mathematical understanding of a framework for the diluted Parisi ansatz described by a random measure on the space of measurable functions and, in particular, with finding new ways to utilize some recent stability results in these models. For perceptron type models, the proposal aims to develop new stability properties with applications to certain cavity computations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many models in the general area of Spin Glasses originate from the attempts to understand the behavior of various optimization problems from different branches of science (physics, computer science, biology) and, more specifically, their average or typical behavior rather than focusing on one fixed scenario. This is done by randomizing the parameters of the problem and then trying to answer several key questions using the methods from Statistical Physics and Probability Theory. In the seventies and eighties, the physicists developed a number of novel ideas to approach these very difficult questions, first, in the setting of the now famous Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, and then later successfully applied these ideas to other models as well. The ideas of the physicists were for the most part heuristic and are often described by the German word "Ansatz" which means "an educated guess that is verified later by its results". In recent years, many of these ideas have been confirmed rigorously, especially, in the setting of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. The goal of this project is to build upon recent progress and try to confirm other, even more bold, predictions of the physicists that are crucial for broader applicability of their ideas.</AbstractNarration>
