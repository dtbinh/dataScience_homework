    <AbstractNarration>PI: Fu, Jianping&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Michigan - Ann Arbor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Development of efficient nanofluidic sieving structures represents a major step toward optimizing bioseparation methods and integrating them onto a fully integrated bioanalysis microsystem. In light of the current research thrust of nanofluidic proteomics, it becomes critically important to understand molecular transport properties in constraining nanofluidic sieving environments. Thus, the major goal of this research is to study, both experimentally and theoretically, molecular dynamics in confining nanofluidic environments and how such knowledge can be utilized to design novel nanofluidic sieving structures for advanced bioseparation. Different micro- and nano-fabrication methods will be applied to generate sub-100 nm nanofluidic sieving structures. These nanofluidic structures will be carefully examined to investigate how their separation performances (such as size selectivity and separation resolution) are affected by different structural parameters of the nanofluidic structures and the external electric fields. Experimental results will be used to guide developments of kinetic models and further validate them. Reciprocally, predictions from theoretical modeling will be used to motivate new separation assays and guide improved designs and generations of the nanofluidic sieving structures. The two-way validation process between experiments and theoretical modeling will lead to a rigorous understanding of molecular dynamics in the confining nanofluidic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Owing to its cross-disciplinary nature, the proposed research will seamlessly integrate knowledge from distinct fields including micro/nanofabrication, micro/nanofluidics, hindered transport, polymer physics, and fluorescence imaging of single molecules. The proposed research, if successful, will foster transformative progress for separation of physiologically-relevant molecules using synthetic nanofluidic structures, a critical step toward fulfilling the promise of the nanofluidic proteomic research and future highly integrated bioanalysis micro/nanosystems. The proposed research will also lead to a thorough understanding of molecular dynamics in the confining nanofluidic geometry, which could provide a novel basis for ultra-sensitive and high-resolution sensors and medical diagnostic systems. The proposed educational activities will have broad impacts on students from different educational levels and genders and ethnicities. Some of the technologies described in the proposal will be used as vehicles for outreach activities to K-12 students and other underrepresented female and minority students in the Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti school districts. The proposed outreach activities will reveal to K-12 students the exciting challenges in science and engineering and their close relevance to our society, thus motivating them to pursue science and engineering curricula. For undergraduate and graduate education, an interdisciplinary course in Micro/Nanofluidics and BioMEMS will be developed. This course will prepare engineering students to pursue research in a variety of multidisciplinary areas such as BioMEMS and Lab-on- Chip, analytical chemistry, and micro/nanoscale materials sciences.</AbstractNarration>
