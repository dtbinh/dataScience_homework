    <AbstractNarration>Stanford University has been awarded a grant to purchase a confocal scanning laser microscope and establish a related multi-user facility at Hopkins Marine Station (HMS) to serve multiple marine laboratories in the Monterey Bay Peninsula, California. High-resolution imaging is now an essential part of the contemporary tool kit of cell and developmental biological processes. Confocal microscopy, along with advances in fluorescent labeling of protein and nucleic acids, has resulted in unprecedented insights into the 3D architecture and function of cells and tissues of many marine organisms. An important application of this technology is visualization of cellular elements and processes related to early development, physiology, and neurobiology. This technical ability also has broader implications for elucidating the interactions of marine animals with their environment. Ultimately, the environment acts on organisms through its effects on cells and tissues. Ocean acidification, deoxygenation and other processes will alter ecosystems and fisheries through effects on individual organisms. This microscope will help address how the various facets of climate change are impacting critical aspects of the cell/developmental biology and physiology of a variety of marine species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This piece of equipment will directly benefit 5 research labs at HMS with an immediate potential benefit to 10 graduate students, and provide outstanding undergraduate training opportunities during research training apprenticeships. The microscope will be housed at HMS but be available to researchers and their students at other research institutions in the local area, including the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute at Moss Landing and California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB). There are many faculty at these institutions with a wide range of research interests who plan to use this microscope upon availability. HMS will partner with CSUMB Bay to create training opportunities on this microscope for the McNair Scholars program for gifted minority students to prepare them for doctoral studies. The image data generated from this equipment will be highlighted in the regular public lectures and open houses at HMS, and on a web-based resource dedicated to early embryogenesis and larval development of marine invertebrates. An imaging collaboration between HMS and the Monterey Bay Aquarium (MBA) will develop a greater public awareness of the diversity of embryos and larvae of marine invertebrates by spotlighting image data using the extensive established outreach mechanisms of the MBA both in formal public exhibits and Facebook postings.
