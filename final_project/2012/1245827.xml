    <AbstractNarration>NSF CC-NIE Network Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt; ASCED - An Advanced Scientific Collaboration Environment and DMZ&lt;br/&gt;M.K. Gardner, S.W. Ellingson, K.R. Bisset, R.B. Knapp, and E.J. Brown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaboration in scientific discourse is as much about building&lt;br/&gt;community as it is about data sharing. It is about discipline-specific&lt;br/&gt;web portals to ease data discovery and to facilitate access. It is&lt;br/&gt;about validated tools for working with the data and about the means&lt;br/&gt;for replicating results. It is about data curation and management. It&lt;br/&gt;is about controlling access to the data in order to obey regulatory&lt;br/&gt;requirements. And it is about the social interactions between&lt;br/&gt;scientists. Successful collaborations already address these issues,&lt;br/&gt;but in ad hoc ways. New collaborations must tackle the same challenges&lt;br/&gt;over and over gain. It would be much more productive if a standard&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure existed for building and hosting collaboration&lt;br/&gt;environments and communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advanced Scientific Collaboration Environment and DMZ (ASCED) is a&lt;br/&gt;standardized infrastructure, based upon open source components, for&lt;br/&gt;building and hosting scientific communities. It is built upon the&lt;br/&gt;Science DMZ, an infrastructure for efficiently sharing data, by&lt;br/&gt;including a private cloud for hosting collaboration environments. It&lt;br/&gt;supports role-based access control, facilitates data management, and&lt;br/&gt;provides PIs with tools for abiding by regulatory requirements. It is&lt;br/&gt;a standard base upon which scientific communities can be built,&lt;br/&gt;allowing future proposals to focus on the specifics of their research.&lt;br/&gt;It is also envisioned that ASCED will be used as a platform for&lt;br/&gt;educators to engage students at all levels. And it can be a platform&lt;br/&gt;for engaging the public, both in the dissemination of results and in&lt;br/&gt;participating in research.</AbstractNarration>
