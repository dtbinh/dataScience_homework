    <AbstractNarration>The Research Initiation Award entitled -Biochemical Basis of Interaction between Keratin-Derived Materials and Schwann Cells - seeks to explore the specific mechanisms by which the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) keratin class of proteins interacts with Schwann cells and induces intracellular changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has three goals. First, there is a need to refine the understanding and classification of ECM proteins such as keratins. Long considered as only structural in nature, recent research has shown numerous regulatory activities for ECM proteins. While several classifications of keratins are known to exist, there is a dearth of knowledge to their specific roles and their three-dimensional structures. Second, this project will elucidate the cell surface mechanism by which interaction with keratin leads to nuclear changes in Schwann cells, particularly in regards to how Schwann cells react to chemical stimulants in their microenvironments. Cellular signaling attributed to keratin is not well-studied and could lead to a transformative understanding of the role of these biomolecules in regulatory processes of an organism. Third, the project will continue to study structure and function of Schwann cells in collaboration with the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. The goal is to investigate how the state of keratin impacts cellular response. This project has a strong educational component, involving undergraduate students in a meaningful way.</AbstractNarration>
