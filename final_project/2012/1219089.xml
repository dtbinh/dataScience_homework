    <AbstractNarration>This research will study ways to ease the production and&lt;br/&gt;use of high-performance matrix algebra software. Matrix algebra&lt;br/&gt;calculations constitute the most time-consuming part of simulations&lt;br/&gt;in diverse fields, and lowering the runtimes of those computations&lt;br/&gt;can have a significant impact on overall application performance. The&lt;br/&gt;process of converting matrix algebra from algorithm to high-quality&lt;br/&gt;implementation is, however, a complex one. At each step, the code&lt;br/&gt;developer is confronted with a myriad of possibilities, many requiring&lt;br/&gt;expertise in numerical computation, mathematical software, compilers,&lt;br/&gt;and computer architecture. In response to these difficulties, the PIs&lt;br/&gt;have developed a prototype taxonomy implementation entitled Lighthouse,&lt;br/&gt;which is a guide to the linear system solver routines from the software&lt;br/&gt;package LAPACK. It is the first framework that combines a matrix algebra&lt;br/&gt;software ontology with code generation and tuning capabilities. Its&lt;br/&gt;interface is designed for users across a spectrum of disciplines, career&lt;br/&gt;levels, and programming experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will dramatically extend the Lighthouse framework in a number of new directions. &lt;br/&gt;First, they will construct a general taxonomy of software that can be used to build&lt;br/&gt;highly-optimized mathematical applications. The taxonomy will initially&lt;br/&gt;provide an organized ontology of software components for high-performance&lt;br/&gt;matrix algebra and later other numerical software from a variety of&lt;br/&gt;problem domains. It will serve as a guide to practitioners seeking&lt;br/&gt;to learn what is available for their mathematical programming tasks,&lt;br/&gt;how to use it, and how the various parts fit together. Second, the PIs&lt;br/&gt;will apply a combination of source code analysis and machine learning&lt;br/&gt;techniques to fully automate the generation of parameterized models that,&lt;br/&gt;given representative inputs and a simple architecture description, can be&lt;br/&gt;evaluated to identify methods from various libraries that best reflect&lt;br/&gt;the user's resource and performance requirements. This automation is&lt;br/&gt;critical for ensuring that the taxonomy is comprehensive enough to be&lt;br/&gt;useful and that it accurately reflects the features and performance&lt;br/&gt;of the latest versions of numerical libraries. Finally, the PIs will&lt;br/&gt;advance the state-of-the-art in tuning tools by improving some of the&lt;br/&gt;tools included in the taxonomy, broadening their ranges of functionality&lt;br/&gt;in terms of problem domains and languages. This project will produce&lt;br/&gt;the following impacts: greater performance by applications, enabling&lt;br/&gt;both more discovery with available computing resources and greater&lt;br/&gt;productivity of application programmers; greater understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;interaction between architecture and algorithms; and an educational tool&lt;br/&gt;for future computational scientists.</AbstractNarration>
