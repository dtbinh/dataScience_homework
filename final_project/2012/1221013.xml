    <AbstractNarration>Given the central role of diabatic heating in Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) physics and theory along with the demands for reducing model deficiencies in simulating and predicting the MJO and related phenomena, it is of great interest and urgent need to explore how MJO vertical heating structures are represented in current General Circulation Models (GCMs). To address this demand, a joint research activity has been suggested and formulated by the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) World Weather Research Program (WWRP)/THORPEX MJO Task Force (MJOTF) and the GEWEX Atmospheric System Study (GASS). The objectives of the international research activity are to characterize, compare and evaluate the heating, moistening and momentum mixing processes associated with the MJO that are produced by present-day global weather and climate models, with a focus on their vertical structure. The GASS activity represents the first multi-model comparison and evaluation of the vertical structure and evolution of diabatic processes of the MJO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are to: (i) support a contribution of overall organizational leadership to the MJOTF and GASS diabatic processes experiment; (ii) provide the logistical and management support associated with the climatological component of the experiment; and (iii) undertake the initial/lead analysis of the climatological component of the experiment. A tangible outcome, of this project is that it will provide valuable guidance for improving model fidelity in representing a number of fast processes, including convection, clouds, radiation, and boundary layer, associated with the MJO and related tropical phenomena. Such improvements have the potential to improve forecasting at subseasonal time scales. Thus this project has substantial broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>
