    <AbstractNarration>This award is derived from the outstanding results of a previous pilot study. In the pilot study, limited to the Philadelphia area, found that children and families learned and assimilated STEM concepts better when there was an integrated system that combined children's literature and hands-on/inquiry based STEM experiments. The new phase of this effort will explore more deeply some of the practices and add 10 more sites across the country. In adding this new cadre, the "established" practices will be challenged, new challenges will be discovered, and new cultures will engender new challenges. The project is a collaborative effort by the Franklin Institute, the University of Washington and the University of Delaware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic instructional materials will be given to the new sites and workshops will be held during the tenure of this award to establish the goals and objectives. Further, monthly teleconferences will keep everyone informed of issues and challenges that arise. In addition, due to the variation across the Nation in terms of culture and backgrounds, each new site will have the freedom to accommodate its clientele and maintain the standards.</AbstractNarration>
