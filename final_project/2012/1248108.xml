    <AbstractNarration>Some processes in biology are difficult for novice learners to visualize. One solution is to use biological animations as a learning tool to model sub-cellular processes, create photo-realistic depictions of events, and simulate conditions where users can vary parameters to compare outcomes. Animations can convey information, allow users to visualize processes they could not otherwise see, or challenge users to explain what they see. Current animation projects involve interdisciplinary teams of biologists, media developers, and often assessment specialists. However, at present, each team works in relative isolation. This RCN-UBE project will bring together animation teams to discuss multiple aspects of animation in biological education and to see if there is potential for a large-scale collaborative network. Twenty-five invitees to a two-day meeting will share approaches on both intellectual and technical levels through small and large group interactions. Small group interactions will focus on comparing methods of animation or assessment plans, whereas large group interactions will focus on discussions of why an entire project is successful at capturing the imagination of users. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This new network will create a forum for comparing: 1) animation techniques; 2) challenges and benefits associated with each technique; 3) assessment plans; and 4) the learning value of the resources created. A discussion of the process by which animations are developed and refined is also expected. We presume that commonalities in approach will emerge, and we plan to develop these in a white paper that defines the current status of animation as a teaching tool for biology and offers guidance to new users. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The initial group invited to the incubator meeting is diverse in four ways: (1) it includes scientists working at the cellular level, as well as organismal biologists who study microbes, plants, and animals; (2) it includes faculty who specialize in undergraduate education, museum science, and professional training; (3) it involves the student perspective; and (4) it brings together biologists, visual artists (animators), and assessment specialists. This diversity will allow for technical discussions among animators and evaluators, as well as broader discussions across areas of biology. Participants will learn from each other, so their future work will be enhanced in scope, educational value, and technique. The white paper will be valuable to others entering the animation field in biology. Network members have experience in small and large-scale dissemination of results, so interaction should be transformative for meeting participants and widespread for the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts towards support of Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>
