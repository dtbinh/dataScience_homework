    <AbstractNarration>This project studies an approximation methodology known as mean field equilibrium (MFE), &lt;br/&gt;which can be used for management, design, and control of large dynamic economic systems &lt;br/&gt;such as financial markets, power markets, sponsored search auctions, online marketplaces,&lt;br/&gt;and resource sharing systems such as cloud computing platforms. &lt;br/&gt;In a mean field equilibrium, individuals &lt;br/&gt;postulate that fluctuations in the empirical distribution of other&lt;br/&gt;players' states have "averaged out" due to large scale, and thus&lt;br/&gt;optimize holding the state distribution of other players fixed. &lt;br/&gt;MFE simplifies system description, making optimization, design, and&lt;br/&gt;control possible. Such a simplification in the equilibrium concept&lt;br/&gt;delivers the best of both worlds: not only is it more believable, but&lt;br/&gt;it provides a tool to understand the impact of parameter and design&lt;br/&gt;changes on the performance of these complex dynamic systems. This&lt;br/&gt;project develops methods to mathematically characterize regimes where MFE&lt;br/&gt;is a viable equilibrium concept, as well as to develop algorithms to&lt;br/&gt;compute and learn MFE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research results could be employed in practice&lt;br/&gt;to leverage the huge advances in computation and availability of big data &lt;br/&gt;generated by complex economic systems for developing&lt;br/&gt;more structured and principled prediction of the impact of design&lt;br/&gt;changes. In support of this goal, the project includes efforts to make MFE&lt;br/&gt;techniques accessible to engineering students through educational&lt;br/&gt;materials and course curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
