    <AbstractNarration>Located in the heart of the American Southwest, the University of Arizona Insect Collection (UAIC) is the oldest, largest and most geographically diverse arthropod museum in the state of Arizona. For the past century the UAIC has been focused on the Sonoran Desert Region (including the Madrean Sky Islands), one of the most biodiverse regions of North America. It contains many unique records of endemic species, including documentation of changes in species distribution patterns and northward expansion of insect pests into the region. Today the collection contains 2 million research specimens, 83% identified to the species-level. This project will provide funds to install a mobile storage system, with modern steel cabinets, drawers and unit trays. By making the proposed improvements, (1) the future of 2 million high value specimens will be assured, (2) much needed new space for growth and research will be available, (3) collection data and images of all species held in the collection will be searchable online for professionals, agencies and the public, and (4) a very popular outreach program for schoolchildren and the public will be able to thrive. Safeguarding the future of this collection and making associated specimen-level data available online will impact many communities by providing a valuable resource for academic researchers, federal and state agencies in both conservation and agriculture, and the public.</AbstractNarration>
