    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop secure/covert short-range wireless personal area communication networks by addressing the critical technical challenges of RF communications in harsh environments. The key new contributions in this proposed work include advanced techniques in the following areas: RF channel equalization, multi-pulse modulation for covertness and enhanced data security at the physical layer, adaptive noise and interference cancellation, multiple-input multiple-output antennas for capacity maximization, and wideband antenna design techniques for overcoming severe signal attenuation or distortions. Success in Phase I will lead to development of a powerful and flexible Software Defined Radio solution for covert communications with exceptionally high data security and operating in harsh propagation environments for distances up to at least 100 m. Proposed techniques are virtually certain to overcome the main obstacles that have prevented previous traditional communications systems, including the ultra-wideband ones, from succeeding in an array of commercial and government applications such as first-responder communications, communications in harsh environments, and related areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is not only significant for defense and related government applications, but may also enable numerous commercial opportunities. On the government and military market fronts, there are numerous Department of Defense and intelligence community needs that can be better addressed by the novel communications system approach proposed. These include shipboard communications systems, urban rescue missions, some subset of tactical communications in harsh environments, intelligence field missions requiring stealthy communications in all environments (including urban settings), and many others. Beyond the clear national security payoffs, broader societal payoffs could include personal security, police and fire rescues, and possibly other less obvious applications involving short-range communications and personal area networks. It is expected that these advances will enable successful communications systems in many areas where traditional systems fail, and that the funding of this project will facilitate a much broader set of high-impact, dual-use applications. The proposed new communication systems embody unique features, modulation schemes, and other technical methods which will expand the understanding and applicability of these novel approaches to difficult communication environments.</AbstractNarration>
