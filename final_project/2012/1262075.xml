    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: With funding provided by the National Science Foundation's Divisions of Materials Research and Chemistry, West Virginia University will host a Multifunctional Nanomaterials Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site. This project focuses on solving fundamental engineering and scientific problems related to surfaces, toxicity and fluid transport in a variety of configurations both experimentally and theoretically. Projects will focus on multifunctional nanomaterials and fabrication of complex devices with applications to biometrics, environmental monitoring, early disease detection, and energy efficiency. The approach includes: use of scanning probe acceleration microscopy to study nanoscale mechanical responses of biologically relevant surfaces; synthesis of fullerene fragments as templates for carbon nanotubes; use of ultrafast laser spectroscopy to characterize and coherently control nanophotonic materials for optical detection and light harvesting devices; use of microsurgery to assess microvascular toxicity after exposure to engineered nanomaterials; cell-based monitoring assays and characterization of cell fate to assess toxicity of nanomaterials; modeling of liver functions using P450 enzymes attached to self-assembled monolayers with subsequent elucidation of the role of substrate binding in controlling electron transfer and enzyme activity of P450; and fabrication and characterization of a) multiferroic thin films for integration into memory devices, b) non-mechanical valves composed of nanogels for point-of-care testing, and c) microfluidic polydimethylsiloxane tissue bioreactors for characterization of carbon nanotubes and their chronic effects on lung epithelial cells. REU participants carry out their research in collaboration with faculty and graduate students and are trained on modern scientific equipment (AFM, X-ray reflectivity and diffraction, capillary electrophoresis, photolithography, SEM, etc.) and/or in the use of computer modeling software. The project includes training that is important to the development of future scientific leaders, e.g. scientific ethics, laboratory safety, communication, collaboration and technical presentation skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Undergraduate student participants (10 per year) in this Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site are integrated into scientific investigations in order to train the next generation of U.S. scientists and engineers. This project primarily supports participation of women, underrepresented minorities, U.S. Armed Forces veterans and persons from economically depressed areas (e.g., Appalachia). Involvement will improve the likelihood that participants will enroll in graduate-level science and engineering education programs, thereby improving the scientific workforce of the U.S. Participants are provided with a comprehensive program that rapidly moves them toward research independence. This preparation includes day-to-day research work on nanomaterials-related projects intermingled with training in: the research process and cutting-edge scientific instrumentation; laboratory safety and scientific ethics; and communication and collaboration. Research projects are geared to the eventual development of new hybrid electronic and photonic devices that will lead to a new generation of biometric, environmental monitoring, early disease detection, and energy efficient device applications.</AbstractNarration>
