    <AbstractNarration>This award is concerned with a broad range of research in gravitational physics, including research projects in classical general relativity, cosmology, quantum field theory in curved spacetime, and quantum gravity. The specific research topics include the development of a new method for determining the stability of black holes, the determination of the higher order corrections to the motion of a particle due to the gravitational force it exerts upon itself, an investigation of the relationship between the description of cosmological models in Newtonian gravity and in general relativity, improvements and extensions of a method to determine the effects produced by gravitational lensing on extremely distant sources, and the development of an approach to quantum gravity that may allow one to give a perturbative definition of the theory that is independent of the choice of the classical background solution about which one performs the expansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the above topics have important applications to such areas as cosmology and the modeling of souces of gravitational waves, but the main goal of this research is to obtain a deeper understanding of the mathematical and physical properties of classical and quantum general relativity. This award also will heavily involve the direct participation of graduate students and a postdoctoral research associate in all aspects of the proposed research, and it will thereby contribute to their training. Some of the areas of research associated with this proposal are of considerable interest to the public, and activities (such as giving public lectures) will be undertaken that aid in the dissemination of scientific knowledge to the public.</AbstractNarration>
