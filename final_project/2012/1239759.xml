    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this EAGER project is to investigate a new and potentially general approach of using light to alter the properties of various photoresponsive polymers. This approach is based on photo-induced proton transfer. The photo-induced proton transfer will be realized using novel photoacids recently developed by the PI. He will attempt to demonstrate polymers that reversibly alter their mechanical, geometrical, electronic, optical, and/or magnetic properties, and release functional molecules upon photo-irradiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photo-induced proton transfer in polymers can alter electronic structures, induce ionic interactions, catalyze chemical reactions, and thus alter the properties of the resulting materials. The proposed project utilizes a new type of photoacid that works as as a bridge between photon and proton so that many polymer properties can be controlled with light. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will attempt to provide a general approach to develop various polymers that respond to light in a variety of different ways. If successful, the resulting polymers could have useful mechanical, electronic, optical and biomedical properties. Therefore, successful implementation of this project could have a broader impact in both scientific and industrial communities. Graduate students involved in this project will receive interdisciplinary training in polymer science, photochemistry, and materials science.</AbstractNarration>
