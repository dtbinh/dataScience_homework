    <AbstractNarration>The research objectives of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project are to investigate the behavior of offshore wind turbines subjected to hurricane loads and to develop novel approaches that can reduce the damage. Specific research activities include: (1) to establish a time-domain analysis procedure that considers interactions of wave, wind, soil, and structure; (2) to study the behavior of wind turbine using the loading consistent with the field observations of hurricanes; (3) to devise a piezoelectric surface actuation mechanism to aerodynamically reduce the wind forces; and (4) to explore the reconfiguration of the structure to reduce the drag forces. The new time-domain formulation of the wind turbine tower will be integrated with the turbine analysis program FAST developed and maintained by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Recent field observations of hurricane characteristics will be utilized to define the loading. Wind tunnel testing of scaled models will also be conducted to obtain necessary parameters for numerical simulation, and to quantify the effects of the piezoelectric surface actuation in reducing the drag forces.&lt;br/&gt;Offshore wind farms have enormous energy potential, yet one of the major concerns is vulnerability of wind turbines in hurricanes. The results of this project can reduce risk to wind turbine structures in hurricanes and can contribute to wider adoption of the offshore wind energy. The Principal Investigator will collaborate with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory so that the research outcome is accessible to a wider audience. The research project is integrated with education through involvement of undergraduate and graduate students as well as involvement of underrepresented students through the college's partnership with a minority-serving institution. In order to increase the number of engineers who can work in renewable energy field, college-wide collaboration in renewable energy and the Florida State University (FSU) Office of Distance Learning will be utilized. The outreach of this project will involve high school students in research through the FSU Young Scholars Program. Annual workshops for K-12 teachers will be offered with the help of KidWind. Through these workshops, the teachers will develop teaching modules on wind energy to enhance their science curricula.</AbstractNarration>
