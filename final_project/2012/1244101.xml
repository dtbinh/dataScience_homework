    <AbstractNarration>Although it is common knowledge that we receive half of our genes from our mother and half from our fathers, it is less widely known that the genes we inherit can play different roles depending on which parent provided them. For example, genes regulated by parental genomic imprinting (PGI) are silenced either maternally or paternally (depending on the gene) after fertilization. PGI has been characterized in mammals and seed plants, and in both cases has been linked in part to the regulation of maternal resources available to the offspring. Using the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana, it has been found that plants isolated from different regions can promote strong increases in seed size depending on whether they are used as mothers or fathers in crosses. This might further suggest that parental bias for resource allocation, or the even selection of imprinted genes themselves, is subject to variation in natural populations. This project aims to identify the genes involved in these parental effects using recombinant inbred (RI) lines, which are genetic chimeras of two initial parents, and mapping populations that carry visual markers for maternal gene expression. In addition, seed development will be characterized at the cellular level to better describe the developmental outcomes of variation in imprinted or parentally-biased systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. This project seeks to identify seed size genes that may function in short-term adaptive strategies for genomic regulation, accounting for some trait variation between Arabidopsis ascensions. This aspect is directly translatable to novel breeding strategies in agriculture. This project will also aim to advance education at the boundary of biology and mathematics. The RI lines employed are uniquely suited as a classroom tool to bridge basic genetics and physiology with computational methods. A learning module has been created to conduct publishable RI research in the Plant Genetics and Diversity course at Rhodes College. Resources will be generated from these course materials allowing educators at both the university and high school level to employ RI systems in the classroom. Educational goals will be further supported by involving undergraduate researchers at all stages of this work, and underrepresented minorities in science will continue to be actively recruited for these research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Cluster in Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.</AbstractNarration>
