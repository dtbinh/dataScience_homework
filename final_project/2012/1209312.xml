    <AbstractNarration>This action funds George Max Anderson of the University of Louisville to conduct a research project, entitled "Investigation of nanometer-scale silicon carbon based particles to decrease size and increase performance of electronic devices," during the summer of 2012 at Shanghai University in Shanghai, China. The host scientist is Dr. Zihua Xin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in detecting minute differences in nano-scale objects that can result in significant property changes. By analyzing and learning what factors control these property changes, this research promises to exploit these differences to further efforts to miniaturize a wide range of electronic devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
