    <AbstractNarration>Aluminum and its alloys continue to be among the most important materials in use today. Aluminum in involved in various systems to enhance efficiency and material conservation in applications as diverse as transportation, electrical power transmission, electronic packaging, building and construction. NSF funds are requested for partial support of the 13th International Conference on Aluminum Alloys (ICAA-13), to be held June 3 to 7, 2012, at Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU), Pittsburgh, PA. This conference is a specialty conference on Aluminum and its alloys, which is organized by the ICAA International Committee. The technical program consists of ten sessions covering a wide range of topics, which describe scientific breakthroughs in computational modeling, processing techniques, recycling technologies, and the production of novel materials with promising combinations of properties and economic viability. ICAA-13 will bring together researchers from the industrial, national, and university communities, both experimental and theoretical, to discuss the latest scientific and technological developments, as well as the future of aluminum. More than 420 abstracts have been received from researchers worldwide, representing a number of countries across the continents of North and South America, Asia, Europe, and Australia. This conference will cover the most critical and strongly growing subject areas in aluminum materials science. The funding is requested to provide domestic travel and registration for students and postdoctoral researchers, and registrations for several young faculty members. Support is provided by three NSF Programs: Metals and Metallic Nanostructures, Materials and Surface Engineering and Condensed Matter and Materials Theory.</AbstractNarration>
