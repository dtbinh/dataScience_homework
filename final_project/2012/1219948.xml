    <AbstractNarration>The average sea surface temperature (SST) has increased over the last 100 years, rising atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) is lowering the pH of the oceans, and the extent and intensity of low-oxygen bottom waters is growing, at least in certain regions. The biological impacts of these ongoing changes -- warming, acidification, and hypoxia -- have each been studied independently, but few studies have explored the possible interactions among these stressors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research, led by a scientist from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, studies the compounded effects of ocean acidification, hypoxia, and warming on an assemblage of benthic foraminifera collected from the continental shelf off New England. Foraminifera are an ideal organism for this work because they (1) are relatively small, allowing experimentation on statistically significant populations; (2) have both calcareous and non-calcareous representatives; (3) are relatively short-lived so experiments include a major portion of their life cycle; (4) include aerobes and anaerobes; and (5) provide a fossil record allowing comparisons across time. Laboratory culturing experiments will be used to determine the response of benthic foraminifera, in terms of survival and growth, to co-varying parameters of pH and oxygen, and to explore the influence of increased temperature on these responses. The researchers will examine the relative effects of higher pCO2, lower [O2], and higher temperature (T) on both calcareous and non-calcareous benthic foraminifera. In addition, they will examine the pre-Industrial benthic foraminiferal assemblage at the field site, and will compare that assemblage to those produced in the experiments under pre-Industrial (lower than current day) and elevated pCO2 levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global warming, ocean acidification, ocean hypoxia ("dead zones"), and their effect on marine flora and fauna, are of considerable societal interest. Funding of this project supports a Post-Doctoral Investigator, summer research projects of two undergraduate students, and provides a first seagoing experience for approximately ten additional undergraduate students. Also, at least one local high school student will be recruited each year to conduct an affiliated climate-change science fair project.</AbstractNarration>
