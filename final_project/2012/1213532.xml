    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Fereshteh Billiot of Texas A &amp; M University Corpus Christi and Professor Kevin Morris of Carthage College and their undergraduate student researchers will be supported to investigate the effect of pH on chiral recognition by amino acid derived surfactants towards other species. The effect of pH on these surfactants will be studied with solution-phase nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods, combined with other physical characterization methods. The surfactants show promise as pseudo-stationary phases in capillary electrophoresis separations of chiral mixtures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiral molecules are molecules that have "handed" symmetry. They differ in structure from each other only in the sense that they are mirror images of each other. Since they have identical chemical structures, except for their handedness, mixtures of the chiral isomers are difficult to separate. Professors Billiot, Morris and their students are interested in designing new ways to separate chiral isomers. This work has important applications in purification and analysis of pharmaceuticals. The undergraduate students working on this project will gain useful experience in carrying out the physic-chemical characterization of these interesting surfactant systems. As part of this work, Prof. Billiot will continue her strong efforts at encouraging students from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in the sciences</AbstractNarration>
