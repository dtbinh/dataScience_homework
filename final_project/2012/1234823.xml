    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this collaborative award is to explore chemical and biological quantum nanosensors by combining quantum coherence in hybrid systems consisting of semiconductor quantum dots and metallic nanoparticles with biomolecules' recognition functionalities. The unique feature of these sensors is their capabilities to utilize quantum coherence in such systems to convert the impact of introduction of biological molecules and chemical substances into noticeable and easily measurable physical quantities. The approach will include using collective properties of single and ensemble of quantum dot-metallic nanoparticle systems, such as molecular-type resonances and coherent dynamics of exciton-plasmons coupling, to detect biological and chemical agents with ultrahigh sensitivity. Optical signal transduction includes the way introduction of these agents changes the time delay that is coherently induced in the emission of the quantum dots when these hybrid systems interact with time-dependent laser fields. This research involves fabrication of nanochips consisting of arrays of semiconductor quantum dots and metallic nanoparticles separated from each other by dielectric materials or biomolecules. In such chips either the quantum dots or metallic nanoparticles are biologically functionalized for target detection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will link coherent nanoscience to life science applications and can advance the areas of quantum computers, nanodevices and sensors. Through the outreach program of this research, the high school students in Alabama will acquire first-hand experience of nanoscience through mini-workshops that offer meticulously designed experiments and interactive softwares. This research forms a platform for education of undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary disciplines and provides them unique opportunities to investigate nanoparticle systems that harness biology to function, fabricate and test nano-systems with biological and physical applications, and become familiar with the diverse impacts of nanotechnology. Combination of these issues will prepare the ground for development of new curricula and programs and diversify the research activities in nanoscience.</AbstractNarration>
