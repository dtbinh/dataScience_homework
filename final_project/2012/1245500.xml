    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing an innovative introductory biology course to better prepare K-8 science teachers for the increasing demands of science education. The Next Generation K-12 Science Standards, which are the national "common core" for K-12 science education, include an increased emphasis on the use of scientific practices in K-12 science education. The vision of the new standards is to more fully integrate the teaching of science concepts with inquiry-based investigations performed by the students. Because many teachers have come through a traditional method of science instruction in our colleges and universities they have no personal frame of reference upon which they can model the design of inquiry-based instruction. By designing a college biology course for preservice elementary (K-8) teachers that integrates science content, scientific processes, and scientific pedagogy, the project is increasing the ability of teachers to design and implement inquiry-based lessons and better prepare them to be effective "Next Generation" science teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this project involves improving teacher quality with the expectation of having a cascading effect on the quality of science education regionally and nationally. This project is helping develop and disseminate a new way of educating science teachers that integrates the science content, practices, and pedagogy.</AbstractNarration>
