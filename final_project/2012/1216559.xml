    <AbstractNarration>Title: Novel Numerical Approximation Techniques for Non-Standard Sampling Regimes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anne Gelb and Rosemary Renaut&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs build on their recently developed techniques that fuse methods&lt;br/&gt;from numerical approximation and inverse theory, such as for purposes&lt;br/&gt;of reconstruction fidelity, with those that exploit specific application&lt;br/&gt;information, such as sparsity. Their methods address both theoretical&lt;br/&gt;and practical considerations. Algorithms are proposed for function and/or&lt;br/&gt;image recovery, as well as to characterize and extract important information&lt;br/&gt;from a data set, such as edges, or other features, without necessarily&lt;br/&gt;determining the underlying function. Research objectives include (i)&lt;br/&gt;developing novel approximation approaches for functional and/or feature&lt;br/&gt;recovery from data that is deficient with respect to one or multiple&lt;br/&gt;perspectives, i.e. data is under-sampled or missing, may be noisy, is&lt;br/&gt;measured via a dual representation, or is otherwise non-standard with&lt;br/&gt;respect to traditional numerical approximation techniques; (ii) developing&lt;br/&gt;numerical approximation operators that can be directly applied to practical&lt;br/&gt;data sets, or may provide a feedback to practitioners for improving sampling&lt;br/&gt;protocols; and (iii) integrating techniques from numerical linear algebra&lt;br/&gt;and statistical regularization that are specifically pertinent for obtaining&lt;br/&gt;robust but efficient solutions of ill-conditioned problems when handling&lt;br/&gt;practical data. This research will provide rigorous analysis of all new&lt;br/&gt;algorithms in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness, especially&lt;br/&gt;in the presence of of noise, perturbations, or otherwise incomplete data&lt;br/&gt;information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Practical data collection techniques are becoming increasingly more&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated. User friendly software packages allow disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;scientists to successfully diagnose, predict, model, and determine&lt;br/&gt;important characteristics from a plethora of measured data. Yet,&lt;br/&gt;recent investigations into various reconstruction algorithms for data&lt;br/&gt;collected under modern magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols&lt;br/&gt;have clearly demonstrated shortcomings that arise when pragmatic&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic modifications are used without considering fundamental&lt;br/&gt;mathematical issues regarding accuracy and measurement error. Some&lt;br/&gt;currently employed algorithms in fact yield both incorrect diagnoses&lt;br/&gt;and additional procedural costs. This project extends the PIs prior&lt;br/&gt;research and addresses the development of novel mathematical techniques&lt;br/&gt;for handling issues associated with extracting functional and feature&lt;br/&gt;information from data acquired by non-standard sampling protocols.</AbstractNarration>
