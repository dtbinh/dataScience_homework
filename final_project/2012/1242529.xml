    <AbstractNarration>In this project, researchers seek to understand the long-term impacts of climate change on grassland ecosystems. They use multi-decadal simulation experiments of warmed soil and air temperatures and of summer drought or elevated rainfall to identify how well the characteristics of different plant species predict how communities and ecosystem processes will shift in coming decades. This project also extends research on climate change impacts to the genetic level; recent evidence indicates that some ecosystems may be resistant to climate change because some species can adapt rapidly to new environments. Results to date show that individual species respond over small spatial scales and that these changes may be adaptive. Over the next five years of a ten year project, the researchers will provide long-term data that reveal the details that underlie an apparent stability of plant community structure in response to climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Temperate grasslands are a key contributor to global productivity and their response to global climate change is of critical importance to the future of human welfare. While fertile grasslands show rapid vegetation shifts in response to simulated warming, those on less fertile soils that contain slower-growing species appear more resistant to rapid climate change. Because the latter grasslands account for a large majority of pasture- and range-lands throughout the world, their recalcitrance to climate shifts will have significant ramifications for the future of food and fiber production. The Buxton research site has garnered considerable media attention and will continue to increase community awareness of climate change research through visits from the interested public, now facilitated by a partnership with the Ecological Continuity Trust. The dataset accumulated annually from this study is currently available online to other researchers. Continued involvement and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students of broad racial and ethnic representation from different nations provides valuable opportunities for education and advances international communication in climate change science.</AbstractNarration>
