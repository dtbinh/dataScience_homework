    <AbstractNarration>The International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) will hold the XXXVII International Congress of Physiological Sciences in Birmingham, UK, July 21-26, 2013. The American Physiological Society (APS) will administer a travel grant program offering a limited number of travel awards to qualified scientists interested in attending the IUPS Congress. The APS has conducted a travel grant program and assisted U.S. scientists engaged in physiological research and its applications to attend Congresses every four years since the IUPS Congress was held in Buenos Aires in 1959. Most recently, the APS managed a travel award program for US physiologists for the IUPS Congress in 2009 in Kyoto, Japan. Special emphasis will be given to investigators within 15 years of receiving their doctoral degree and to women and under-represented minority scientists. Travel awards resulting from this proposal will be directed to individuals working in the research areas supported by the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems. Travel awards will 1) promote widespread participation of young scientists with an emphasis on women and under-represented minorities; 2) interest new investigators and students in pursuing research designed to understand physiological processes and traits; and 3) provide opportunities for the development of collaborative interactions with scientists from the United States and those working in other countries. The scientific program for the XXXVII Congress was developed by an international program committee with representatives both from the host society, The Physiological Society, and the IUPS. The program is organized around a number of IUPS Commissions. Traditionally, the one most relevant to NSF is associated with the Commission for Comparative Physiology: Evolution, Adaptation &amp; Environment. While the sessions associated with this Commission are most relevant, there are many others that should be of interest to comparative physiologists, providing physiological insights related to their comparative studies.</AbstractNarration>
