    <AbstractNarration>Epulopiscium spp. are among the largest known bacteria with some cigar-shaped cells reaching lengths in excess of 0.6 mm. Epulopiscium spp. and their relatives are intestinal symbionts associated specifically with certain species of tropical reef fish in the surgeonfish family. They are a conspicuous and usual component of the community of microorganisms that inhabit the fish and they contribute to the digestion of polysaccharides consumed by their fish host. The Angert Lab has been using Epulopiscium sp. type B as a model for studies of cell, developmental and evolutionary biology. This organism has been key in providing a better understanding of how a simple bacterial cell can make small changes in its cellular structure and organization to allow it to reach its tremendous size. The current project seeks to improve this experimental system further by completing the genome sequence of Epulopiscium sp. type B. These efforts will yield an important resource for studying the genetic potential of these exceptional bacteria in the context of cell and developmental biology. Gene expression in actively growing populations of Epulopiscium sp. type B will be characterized to identify genes that are essential for supporting cell growth and metabolism. This profile will provide the basis for improving methods to grow these bacteria in laboratory culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This project provides significant educational and training opportunities for postdoctoral and undergraduate research assistants. All trainees will gain experience in molecular biology, microbiology, DNA sequence analysis, and the application of basic bioinformatics tools. Through research presentations, manuscript and proposal preparation, trainees will develop their communication skills. Depending on the project, an individual will gain more extensive experience in bioinformatics, evolutionary biology, and genomics. Such research experiences are essential for the development of a young scientist.</AbstractNarration>
