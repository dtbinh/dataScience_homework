    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Natalie Gumataotao of Loyola University Chicago to conduct a research project, entitled "Investigation of metal-protein interactions during an industrial enzyme's synthesis," during the summer of 2012 at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Masafumi Odaka.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to examine a metal transporting protein, or metallochaperone, involved in the maturation of the metalloenzyme thiocyanate hydrolase. The structure of this metallochaperone suggests that the protein traffics metals differently from other well-characterized metallochaperones. Metallochaperone research is a relatively new field with much left to be studied. Understanding how essential metals are regulated in biological systems has many potential applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
