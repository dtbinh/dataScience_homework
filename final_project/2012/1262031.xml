    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the continuation of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates and Research Experiences for Teachers REU/RET site within the Center for Astrophysics, Space Physics and Engineering Research at Baylor University. Thirty participating students will be actively engaged in cutting edge research under the direct supervision of energetic faculty mentors through the completion of self-contained ten week projects in a collaborative research environment. Student research opportunities are in the areas of astrophysics, complex plasma physics, cosmology, elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, quantum optics, space physics, and superstring physics. The site further provides research opportunities at the Center for up to fifteen teachers, who also develop curricula to take back into the classroom. Participants engage in twice-weekly seminars, an Undergraduate Research Symposium at the end of the summer and specially designed classes in various research areas of interest.</AbstractNarration>
