    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Emily Gasser of Yale University to conduct a research project, entitled "Reconstructing Language History in the Pacific with Statistical Modeling," during the summer of 2012 at the University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand. The host scientist is Professor Russell Gray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to contribute to the development of the Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database and to analyze the data therein using Bayesian phylogeographic methods, thus exploring settlement and migration patterns of the Austronesians into eastern Indonesia and the island Pacific. This project contributes new knowledge concerning the Austronesian language family and more broadly to the field of historical linguistics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
