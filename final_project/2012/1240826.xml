    <AbstractNarration>This award, in the amount $10,000, is to enable students to attend The 56th International Conference on Electron, Ion and Photon Beam Technology and Nanofabrication, 2012, to be held at the Hilton Waikoloa Village, Waikoloa, Hawaii, May 29 to June 1, 2012. In the fields of nanofabrication, electron and ion-beam lithographies, photon and imprint lithographies, particle-beam optics, and forefront applications of nanofabrication, this conference is preeminent. The requested travel aid will enable students to present their research to a high level international scientific community. They will observe how scientists and engineers exchange innovative ideas and other information at conferences, and they?ll hear first-hand presentations of up-todate research results in nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning how a technical conference serves as a venue for conveying information to other is an important element of a student?s education. Also important is leaning how to present, in a cogent and understandable way, the results of one?s research. The requested&lt;br/&gt;support will help to accomplish these ends. At the conference, students will make important personal contacts and learn of employment opportunities. At a special student breakfast, the conference organizers will describe to the students optimal techniques for presenting scientific information and how the conference program is put together.</AbstractNarration>
