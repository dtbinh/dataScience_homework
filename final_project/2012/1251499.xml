    <AbstractNarration>In an effort to advance Continental Scientific Drilling in the USA, DOSECC is organising a&lt;br/&gt;series of topical workshops. The workshop proposed here has two objectives, firstly to advance&lt;br/&gt;scientific studies of active high-enthalpy hydrothermal systems, and secondly to foster collaboration&lt;br/&gt;between academic scientists, government agencies, and industry. Such collaboration is highly&lt;br/&gt;desirable because the scientific study of active hydrothermal systems requires drilling and&lt;br/&gt;sampling boreholes whose costs far exceed budgets normally available to academic scientists,&lt;br/&gt;whereas the geothermal industry commonly drills wells that access them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) represents an excellent example of such a collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;From the outset academic scientists have been deeply involved in that project. The IDDP is&lt;br/&gt;investigating the economic feasibility of producing electricity from supercritical geothermal&lt;br/&gt;reservoirs. To test this concept an industry consortium planned to drilled a deep well in&lt;br/&gt;the volcanic caldera of Krafla. However drilling had to be terminated at 2.1 km depth when&lt;br/&gt;900C rhyolite magma flowed into the well. Today the well is highly productive, estimated to&lt;br/&gt;be capable of generating &gt;35 MWe of dry superheated steam at a well-head temperature of ~440C.&lt;br/&gt;There is a significant undeveloped potential for developing high-enthalpy geothermal systems&lt;br/&gt;in the western USA, Hawaii and Alaska. Although drilling into these deep unconventional geothermal&lt;br/&gt;reservoirs is more expensive, the higher productivity per well should offset this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to compile and distribute a report that addresses industry's interest, abilities,&lt;br/&gt;research needs, and potential for collaborative projects that drill high-enthalpy systems.&lt;br/&gt;This will be based on the results of a broadly distributed questionnaire, and a three day&lt;br/&gt;workshop with participation by industry, government and university scientists. Hopefully this&lt;br/&gt;will help create a national program that enhances the scientific, technological and institutional&lt;br/&gt;basis for the development of new and more economic sources of alternative energy.</AbstractNarration>
