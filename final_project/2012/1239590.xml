    <AbstractNarration>Project Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is establishing a founding network node at Georgia Tech (GT) to successfully replicate the I-Corps curriculum at geographically distributed regions throughout the nation and further study how innovation permeates the academic culture. Although the current NSF I-Corps program trains the nation's researchers in cutting-edge customer development methods, it does not offer additional support for start-ups once the go/no-go decision is made. Providing support to local teams is offering great benefit, since most researchers are unlikely to relocate to the most active geographical regions of entrepreneurial activity. Building a robust network of innovation nodes across the country is critical to help support potential start-ups; therefore, this project is leveraging a connected group of knowledgeable and highly experienced groups to help mitigate the issues and risks associated with creating new enterprises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GT node is delivering the I-Corps hypothesis/validation-based (Lean LaunchPad LLP) curriculum that focuses on customer development methodology to cohorts of NSF-designated teams on a semi-annual basis. This allows for training and development of I-Corps teams in multiple locations, while additionally increasing the breadth/depth of training and helping to scale the overall impact of the I-Corps program. GT organized a team of trainers to present the I-Corps curriculum to I-Corps teams and help expand the pool of prospective I-Corps faculty who are able to teach the I-Corps curriculum, work with the selected teams and help to further inform the national innovation network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The establishment of an I-Corps node at Georgia Tech is fostering the pursuit of both short-term and long-term research and development projects to help achieve the goals of the NSF I-Corps program. The GT node is researching, analyzing, and leveraging data from the I-Corps education, training, and opportunity development efforts to: 1) develop an understanding of how institutions can improve support for innovation ecosystems; 2) create and share methods for successfully scaling effective practices and models that foster innovation; 3) explore how the network can enable new collaborations among geographic regions to support commercialization opportunity development, independent of geographic locations; 4) examine and track the I-Corps teams' dynamics, activities and outcomes; and 5) identify and propose improvements to the I-Corps curriculum materials, training practices, and national innovation network utilization. The GT node is expanding the I-Corps cadre of innovation experts that are disseminating effective practices, fostering a change in culture (particularly in academia) and helping to mentor others in their business development efforts on a national scale.</AbstractNarration>
