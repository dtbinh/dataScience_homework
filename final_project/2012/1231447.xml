    <AbstractNarration>Paleontology is often a core research emphasis of many U.S. natural history museum collections, but to date, the paleocollections community has been less engaged in digitization of specimens and collection information than its neontological counterpart. iDigBio - Integrated Digitized Biocollections, the National Resource for Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections - will conduct a workshop to address the digitization needs, opportunities, and Grand Challenges of the paleontological collections community throughout the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of this workshop are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Allow a forum for dialog and communication among the paleontological collections subdisciplines (vertebrate, invertebrate, paleobotanical, and microfossils).&lt;br/&gt;2. Present examples of on-going digitization initiatives among the neontological collections communities and examples of currently funded digitization projects.&lt;br/&gt;3. Facilitate dialog between the paleo- and neontological collections communities to promote integration of collection data.&lt;br/&gt;4. Facilitate a discussion of the collections digitization needs, priorities, and Grand Challengesfor the paleo community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collection information for biological specimens housed in U.S. institutions holds tremendous value for research, education, and understanding patterns of biodiversity. Integrated biocollection data - from both paleo- and neontological specimens ? can therefore be used for developing conservation, management, and public policy for biodiversity. Four graduate students in paleocollections will be included. These students will have the opportunity to meet professionals in the paleo community and will be able to participate in developing a vision for digitization of paleocollections.</AbstractNarration>
