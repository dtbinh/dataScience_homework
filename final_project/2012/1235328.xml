    <AbstractNarration>The 2013 GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect from Peru to Tahiti will cross an entensive oxygen deficient zone typically described as "suboxic"; however, measurements of sulfate reduction in this region suggest it may have some anoxic characteristics due to the presence of free sulfide. Redox conditions influence the solubility/stability of many trace elements which in turn affects their vertical and horizontal transport. A scientist from Old Dominion University plans to analyze water samples collected during the cruise for dissolved iodate/iodide, arsenic [As(III)/As(V)], selenium [Se(IV, VI), particulate Se(0), and nano- to picomolar hydrogen sulfide speciation (total, free/uncomplexed). These measurements, along with nitrate/nitrite, nitrous oxide, and iron species determined by other participants during the cruise, will be used to constrain the range of redox conditions within the oxygen deficient zone, assess the importance of in-situ reduction versus horizontal advection of the redox species, and the changing redox conditions within the hydrothermal plume of the East Pacific Rise. Availability of this data will also enable other researchers to determine the behavior of other redox sensitive trace elements in the ocean. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As regards the broader impacts, in addition to contributing to the overarching goals of the GEOTRACES Program, one postdoc, one graduate student, and one undergraduate student would be supported and trained as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>
