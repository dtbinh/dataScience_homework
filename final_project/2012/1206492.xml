    <AbstractNarration>Adhikari/1206492&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is to host a workshop on lignocellulosic biofuels at Auburn University from June 13-15, 2012. This award will support travel costs for the speakers attending the workshop. This workshop will bring together a diverse audience with a collective wealth of knowledge that will: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (1) identify research gaps that currently exist in thermal biomass conversion processes &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 2) determine future research directions that will provide immediate and long-term benefits and to help realize the goals of The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, which calls for a reduction in the country's reliance on fossil fuels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (3) exchange information via several panel sessions with distinguished and knowledgeable speakers &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; (4) educate the biofuels community about the relevant issues that need to be addressed to increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of biofuels &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A main goal of this workshop is to identify technological barriers to producing biofuels on a commercial scale from gasification and fast pyrolysis processes. This objective will be achieved by organizing a two-day workshop at Auburn University. Experts in biomass gasification, pyrolysis, and logistics from industry, academia, and national laboratories will be invited to participate in the workshop. This workshop will follow the format of individual presentations followed by panel discussion by experts. Three sessions will be organized during the workshop: (i) biomass logistics, (ii) gasification, and (iii) pyrolysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of the broader impacts, outreach activities will be organized for 7th and 8th grade students who will learn what the gasification and pyrolysis technologies are and how to make biofuels using these technologies. Students will also learn how to make biodiesel from waste vegetable oils recycled from local restaurants. During the students' visit, they will have an opportunity to see a mobile downdraft gasifier. The exchange of ideas and information by speakers and participants will advance the knowledge-base of the participants. It will also foster collaborations leading to basic and applied research that increases the impact of the biofuels community.</AbstractNarration>
