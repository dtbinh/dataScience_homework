    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research aimed at understanding and controlling quantum correlations in solids. In the long term, the two goals of this research program are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Design and development of new materials and structures with useful functionalities that are not currently available, and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Extending the basic scientific framework to understand matter in novel regimes and phases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three main topics to be studied to achieve these goals are: (1) highly quantum magnetism, (2) materials derived from topological insulators, and (3) correlated oxide interfaces. It is envisioned that there will be synergy between these areas. The research will be carried out using a diverse set of theoretical techniques including phenomenological modeling, statistical mechanics, field theory, ab initio simulations, density matrix renormalization group, and symmetry analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general style of this research program is to develop and bring deep theoretical ideas in the theory of solids into fruition in real materials. Quantum magnetism, the first topic, is the most ideal arena to test theories of exotic, non-locally entangled quantum states. Research on quantum spin liquids and magnetization processes is very timely, coinciding with a burst of experimental discoveries and questions raised by them. The second topic defines new directions for the active area of topological insulators, focusing on problems where fundamental theoretical issues still reside, and where opportunities are present for materials synthesis. In the third topic on correlated interfaces, essential issues in this field, such as the driving forces behind the metal-insulator transition and the nature of carriers induced by polarization discontinuities, will be addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports the education of a graduate student and a postdoctoral research associate at the frontiers of condensed matter theory. The PI will incorporate the methods and results from the research into teaching materials, and involve undergraduate students in research providing motivation for them to pursue higher education in physics. The PI will also be involved in disseminating the research results to specialist as well as non-specialist audiences via the group's extensive web site and review articles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research aimed at understanding and controlling quantum mechanical correlations in solids. Focusing on novel phenomena which have been observed or can be engineered in modern materials, the goal of the research is to devise new types of functionalities for these materials, and to expand the theoretical framework which describes quantum phenomena. At the most fundamental level, the work will describe new phases of matter with remarkable properties, and determine how to study and harness those properties in the laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports the education of a graduate student and a postdoctoral research associate at the frontiers of condensed matter theory. The PI will incorporate the methods and results from the research into teaching materials, and involve undergraduate students in research providing motivation for them to pursue higher education in physics.
