    <AbstractNarration>In this project, the investigator will explore the evolution of oceanic crust by analyzing the composition of the lava flows from off-axis seamounts near the Juan de Fuca Ridge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanic crust is created at the axis of mid-ocean ridge spreading centers and is subsequently modified by off-axis volcanism. While mid-ocean ridge basalts erupted on-axis are typically relatively uniform in composition, off-axis seamounts erupt a wide range of compositions suggesting a complex system of melt generation, accumulation, and crystallization beneath these volcanic edifices. The investigator will use geochemical analyses of melt inclusions and associated glasses (including major, trace, and volatile elements) from lavas erupted at several seamounts to geochemically define the magmatic plumbing system beneath off-axis seamounts from melt generation to eruption on the seafloor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results will be integrated with an ongoing study of melt inclusions at the adjacent ridge segment, which will provide a direct comparison between on- and off-axis magmatic systems at depth. Thus, the investigator will be able to systematically assess melt generation, accumulation, and the depth of crystallization beneath off-axis seamounts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include sponsoring an undergraduate student from an under-represented group to work on the research project as a summer intern, and graduate student mentorship. Findings from this project will be presented to the general public in an effort to inspire young scientists at "family science nights" at the New Bedford Ocean Explorium. Data and interpretations will be presented at international conferences. Once published, all data produced will be made available to the scientific community though incorporation into PetDB (www.petdb.org). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the NSF Ocean Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (OCE PRF) program, with goals to support novel research by early career scientists and increase the diversity of the U.S. ocean sciences workforce and research community. With OCE-PRF support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves in an independent research career related to ocean sciences and broaden participation of under-represented groups in the ocean sciences.</AbstractNarration>
