    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;A Workshop on Frontiers in Electronics (WOFE-11) is to be held in San Juan, Puerto Rico during 18-21 December 2011. The Workshop has high intellectual merit and embodies technological exchange and discussion of new ideas and emerging trends in the current rapid evolution of electronic technology. The Workshop focuses on a merger of the major technical areas including low-power digital electronics, microwave power circuits, and optoelectronics, which collectively have become the foundation of today's electronic technology. It aims at fostering an active cross-fertilization of these different areas by gathering experts from academia, industry, and government agencies to review the recent developments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;This workshop will promote exchange of scientific ideas and will make an impact on future science and technology in electronics. It will provide a special forum for leading researchers to review the most recent and exciting breakthroughs in various areas of electronics. Emphasis will be placed on inviting women and members of the under representative minorities. These activities will help to establish future programs for training graduate/ undergraduate students to become the next generation of electronics scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>
