    <AbstractNarration>Project researchers have found there is a scientific as well as public need for persistent Earth and space remote sensing applications. The availability of dense global measurements could enable new techniques in geosciences for imaging the Earth, yielding important observations that could test theoretical models and improve understanding of the planet. Constellations of satellites could additionally be used to provide observations on climate, aurora, radiation belts, albedo clouds, lightning, radiation belts, gravity-hydrology and space weather among many other topics. By placing sensors as ride-along packages on constellations of existing satellite there is the potential to increase the coverage, distribution and amount of data that could be used for scientific and public benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placing additional instruments on existing satellites could ameliorate the need for costly satellite programs. Global imaging capabilities, possible through this technology have the potential to mitigate global issues that impact the public including but not limited to; monitoring of volcanic ash clouds for airplane flights or global monitoring of crop health and the global carbon cycle. Data streams from this technology may provide necessary data for improved weather prediction, climate, space weather and disaster response and recovery.</AbstractNarration>
