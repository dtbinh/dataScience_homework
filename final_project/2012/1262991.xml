    <AbstractNarration>Micro and nanofabrication of solid-state devices are rapidly becoming the key drivers of interdisciplinary research in emerging fields such as nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, nanomechanics, nanophysics, and biotechnology. Such technology is a critical component of modern economic development, and leadership in research on devices for electronics, photonics, and magnetics is a key to sustained US economic competitiveness. One of the greatest challenges in maintaining that leadership is the limited number of undergraduates from US engineering programs who pursue graduate studies in solid-state devices, especially those from underrepresented groups. This REU site the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience in Solid-State Devices for Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetics Technology ("the SURE program")is established to address this need. The SURE program will provide an average of ten students per summer the opportunity to pursue ten weeks of faculty-directed research. The primary goal is to provide each participant with a scientifically rigorous, intellectually demanding research experience within a highly collegial environment of collaboration with faculty and other students, expert guidance in non-technical aspects of professional development, and frequent opportunities for social interaction. Utilization of current and new partnering relationships will be used to increase participation by students from underrepresented groups. This program is supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers of the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>
