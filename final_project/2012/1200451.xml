    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By integrating synthetic and structural principles from several fields including metal chalcogenide cluster chemistry, coordination chemistry, and nanoporous solids, this research supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program seeks to employ complex multi-component and multi-step co-assembly processes to create a new generation of supramolecular chalcogenide clusters and their organized assemblies with organic functional moieties. Specifically, the proposed research seeks to utilize structural and functional diversity of organic molecules to control structures of chalcogenide clusters and extended frameworks and to enhance their electrooptical properties and functionalities. To minimize the possibility for phase separation common in multi-component systems, inorganic and organic components will be chosen so that each component plays a unique role that is complementary to other components, The PI will also seek to pursue metal chalcogenide cluster research in a direction towards the modular synthesis, by developing methods to create pre-designed discrete chalcogenide clusters. The use of pre-assembled supramolecular units not only simplifies the co-assembly process, but also allows the use of milder synthetic conditions to access metastable phase domains, which is particularly desirable for co-assembly into topologies with open architecture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this proposed research, new areas of cross-disciplinary research bordering various fields such as semiconducting nanoparticles, chalcogenide molecular clusters, coordination polymers, and traditional zeolites will be developed. New materials developed in this project will include crystalline high-surface-area semiconductors with potential applications in various energy and environmental science related areas. UC Riverside has the most diverse student population among UC campuses. Undergraduate research is highly supported in the PI's group. The PI is actively involved in various educational and training programs for undergraduate and high school students. The proposed project can be used to infuse a wide and highly diverse student audience with enthusiasm for careers in materials chemistry. The project combines diversity in materials types and various measurement techniques and aims to develop new materials for energy or environmental science related applications. It will therefore provide excellent training opportunities for students in synthesis, structural characterization, and property measurements and prepare them for a challenging, but rewarding career in science.</AbstractNarration>
