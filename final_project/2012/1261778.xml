    <AbstractNarration>The complexity of modern high-end computers has made it exceedingly &lt;br/&gt;difficult for scientific applications to effectively manage resources &lt;br/&gt;such as extreme-scale parallelism, single-chip multi-processors, &lt;br/&gt;and deep hierarchy of shared/distributed caches and memories. In &lt;br/&gt;particular, as machines and applications have both evolved to become &lt;br/&gt;complex and massively parallel, compilers have failed to automatically &lt;br/&gt;bridge the gap between complex software and diverse hardware platforms.&lt;br/&gt;Optimization models for parallel computing have lagged far behind &lt;br/&gt;those for serial applications, and conventional compilers are &lt;br/&gt;increasingly unable to accommodate emerging high-end architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops a new optimization model that allows&lt;br/&gt;1) developers to effectively interact with advanced optimizing &lt;br/&gt;compilers to provide both domain-specific knowledge and high-level &lt;br/&gt;optimization strategies (e.g., directions to enable new or choose &lt;br/&gt;amongst differing parallelization strategies); 2) computational &lt;br/&gt;specialists to easily define arbitrary domain-specific transformations &lt;br/&gt;to directly control performance optimizations to their code; &lt;br/&gt;3) architecture-sensitive optimizations to be easily parameterized &lt;br/&gt;and empirically tuned to achieve portable high performance.&lt;br/&gt;The optimization model is supported with an integrated environment &lt;br/&gt;that contains two main components: ROSE, a C/C++/Fortran2003 &lt;br/&gt;source-to-source optimizing compiler developed at DOE/LLNL; and POET, &lt;br/&gt;a transformation language together with an empirical optimization &lt;br/&gt;engine developed at UTSA. This framework permits different levels &lt;br/&gt;of automation and programmer intervention, from fully-automated tuning &lt;br/&gt;to semi-automated development to fully programmable control. The research &lt;br/&gt;targets both the optimization needs of computational kernels and the more &lt;br/&gt;general requirements of whole program optimizations. The framework is &lt;br/&gt;integrated as an external development mechanism for the widely-adopted &lt;br/&gt;ATLAS library and is connected with empirical tuning research under &lt;br/&gt;DOE SciDAC program to improve the efficiency of large-scale scientific &lt;br/&gt;applications.</AbstractNarration>
