    <AbstractNarration>Wireless sensor-actuator networks (WSAN) are systems consisting of numerous sensing and actuation devices that interact with the environment and coordinate their activities over a wireless communication network. This project studies "resilience" in WSANs. A resilient system is one that maintains an active awareness of surrounding threats and reacts to those threats in a manner that returns the system to operational normalcy in finite time. This project's approach to resilient WSANs rests on two fundamental trends. One trend uses machine-to-machine (M2M) communication networks that promise wireless networking with greater peak bit-rates and reliability than previously possible. The other trend comes from recent ideas that use quantization and event-triggered feedback in a unified manner to reduce bit rates required by real-time control systems. This project will evaluate and demonstrate this integrated control/communication approach to resilience on a multi-robotic testbed consisting of unmanned ground vehicles. The testbed will integrate M2M communication hardware/software with a multi-robot control architecture addressing task coordination and platform stabilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project broadens its impact through organizations and programs on and around the Notre Dame campus that facilitate industrial engagement and technology transfer. The project will engage undergraduate and graduate students to support the project's testbed and algorithm development. The project will augment and re-organize Notre Dame's Cyber-Physical System (CPS) curriculum by integrating the results of this project into courses.</AbstractNarration>
