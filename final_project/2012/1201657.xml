    <AbstractNarration>In September 2010, NSF-TCUP and the NSF Directorate for Engineering made PEEC awards to four Lead institutions. These Lead colleges each formed collaborative partnerships with additional colleges or universities. A total of sixteen (16) institutions have partnered to receive PEEC awards. The PEEC program is making it possible for tribal colleges to develop and implement pre-engineering or engineering degrees at their institutions by forming collaborative partnerships with university-colleges of engineering to which TCUP students may transfer.&lt;br/&gt;A two day workshop, located in Minneapolis, will focus on the best practices for successfully recruiting and retaining students in pre-engineering and engineering. During the workshop participants will discuss issues and participate in formal sessions during which they will share experiences and ideas about the future of pre-engineering and engineering at tribal colleges. A primary focus will be to improve matriculation success rates and the continued development of degree programs at the tribal colleges. NSF-TCUP and Directorate for Engineering officials will participate, as will expert consultants. One outcome will be a publication of the workshop proceedings to include recommendations for program growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of effective engineering degree tracks, appropriate curriculums, methods of instructional delivery, along with the necessary support mechanisms can produce models that can be adapted by other colleges and universities to better serve all underrepresented groups. The workshop will add to the national discussion about broadening participation by sharing how PEEC projects contribute to the global body of knowledge specific to engineering education.</AbstractNarration>
