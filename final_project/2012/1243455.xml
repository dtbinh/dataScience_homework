    <AbstractNarration>It is reported that the current market for bone graft and bone substitute materials is approximately $3 billion with continuous year to year growth due to the aging population. Despite the large demand in bone substitute materials, many currently available products fall short in some key areas. With the previous NSF award and other support, the PI?s research group at the University of Connecticut has developed a novel biomimetic bone scaffold with potentially breakthrough properties compared to currently-available products: (1) superior mechanical properties, providing the necessary mechanical strength for initial surgical handling and mechanical support for enhanced new bone formation; (2) rapid bone formation, which would significantly reduce the rehabilitation time for patients; (3) degradation rate that is identical to the new bone ingrowth rate, leading to near-perfect defect repair with natural bone; and;(4) a fabrication process that is simple, low cost, and easily scaled for mass production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this effort will provide the translation of a novel technology from academic discovery to a commercialized product. I-Corp funding of this proposal will enable the team to establish a better understanding of the current bone substitute market and the needs of consumers, orthopedic and medical device companies and importantly the patients thereby, maximizing the potential success of this novel scaffold. Such an understanding will allow the team to develop a plan that matches market opportunities, and guides the transformation from research and development to a robust product.</AbstractNarration>
