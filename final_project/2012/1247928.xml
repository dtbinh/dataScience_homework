    <AbstractNarration>Objective: &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is to help eliminate key barriers to implementing new spectrum sharing policies though the development of regulatory and enforcement mechanisms that protect incumbents users. The proposed research develops needed enforcement mechanism though developing algorithms for rapid identification and location of users, developing metrics appropriate for enforcement systems, and determining fundamental limits for density of nodes to achieve reliable detection for enforcement. The technology development will be guided by considering legal issues surrounding privacy and whether the technology requires changes to existing telecommunication policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the discovery of novel approaches to transmitter identity and location verification, and the development of metrics that regulators can use to help determine compliance of future spectrum sharing systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are elimination of roadblocks to spectrum sharing mechanisms. The President?s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology identified nearly 1GHz of spectrum that can be shared to spur the economy and establish the United States as the leading technology innovator for dynamic spectrum access. Understanding the technical viability, legal feasibility, and system costs of spectrum sharing enforcement will eliminate fear, uncertainty, and doubt on the part of spectrum owners about moving into a spectrum sharing mode. Our approach also proactively reaches out to the regulatory community and educates them on the new regulatory approaches and enforcement mechanisms made possible by this research.</AbstractNarration>
