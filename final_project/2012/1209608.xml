    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Evan Joon Hyuk Park of Yale University to conduct a research project, entitled "Studying the visual cortex in active animals using optical probes," during the summer of 2012 at Osaka University in Osaka, Japan. The host scientist is Professor Tetsuya Yagi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to further develop miniature microscopes and optical techniques to study the representation and transformation of visual information in the brain, particularly in the primary visual cortex. There are many questions about the visual cortex that still need to be answered and new technologies being developed are providing this opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
