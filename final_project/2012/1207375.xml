    <AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-dimensional electron gas confined to GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures provides a model platform for the study of emergent phenomena brought about by strong electron-electron interactions in systems with reduced dimensionality. Recent theoretical work suggests that the two-dimensional electron system hosts novel phases of matter with previously unanticipated topological order and unusual quasiparticle statistics. The concept of topological order has been extended to many novel materials and it now permeates modern condensed matter physics. Our work focuses on questions of fundamental science of the two-dimensional electron gas such as inducing transitions between the various ground states of interest and the search for novel topological invariants. This project will constitute excellent preparation for a graduate student for his/her future academic or industrial career through the study of modern condensed matter physics and training in modern semiconductor processing, in conducting low level measurements, and in the use of cryogenic equipment. Undergraduate students will be introduced to concepts and techniques used in condensed matter physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies of the fractional quantum Hall effect reveal fascinating rules according to which the interacting quantum mechanical electrons arrange themselves. It has recently come to the fore that it is possible that certain fractional states may have a new type of internal degree of freedom called topological order. The concept of topological order may allow storing and manipulating quantum information in new ways and it has now conceptually been applied to many novel condensed matter materials. For this project we will study this hidden order in clean two-dimensional electron gases. The experiments will be at the confluence of modern semiconductor processing, nanophysics, and state-of-the art cryogenic technology. This project will support the education of a doctoral student in modern condensed matter physics which has historically provided excellent training for carriers both in academia as well as in high tech industries.</AbstractNarration>
