    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award is to develop the processing science for mechanical surface generation so as to enable engineering of magnesium alloy/composite surfaces with specific microstructures that enhance wear performance. The approach involves analysis of mechanics of large strain deformation underlying the unit interaction fundamental to mechanical surface generation - sliding tool interacting with a workpiece surface. Large strain deformation on the workpiece surface will be characterized, in situ, as a function of controllable process variables using advanced experimental mechanics techniques. Microstructure and properties of the surface will be analyzed at multiple length scales using electron microscopy, micro-tensile test, and micro/nano tribology methods, resulting in deformation-microstructure-property maps. Finite element analysis incorporating grain-level plasticity will be used to predict and optimize the deformation in order to create graded surface microstructures with desirable properties. A predictive framework will be established to engineer wear resistant surfaces by control of process variables. Surface generation processes of wide-ranging interest to the discrete products sector including burnishing, surface mechanical attrition, microfinishing, wear and friction stir processing will be impacted by this work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific benefits will be enhanced understanding of deformation phenomena in hexagonal close packed metals and deformation-microstructure-property correlations for structural magnesium alloys. The technological benefits will be new or improved processes for creating magnesium alloy surfaces with novel attributes enabling development of ultra-lightweight powertrain and structural sub-systems for transportation. Broader impacts include improved fuel economy in automotive, aerospace, or other transportation systems and concomitant environmental benefits; and a strong educational component that will contribute towards a workforce competent in advanced processes and structural materials for industrial applications. The education and training program also includes graduate student internships in industry, undergraduate research training for physically challenged students via collaboration with the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, Rochester Institute of Technology, and a modest focus on fostering entrepreneurship in graduate study.</AbstractNarration>
