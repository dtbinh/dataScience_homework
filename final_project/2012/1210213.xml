    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Boon-Ling Yeo of University of California, Davis to conduct a research project, entitled "Optimal Regulation and Management of Nitrogen to the Atmospheric, Terrestrial, and Aquatic Ecosystems," during the summer of 2012 at Motu Economic and Public Policy Research in Wellington, New Zealand. The host scientist is Dr. Suzi Kerr. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in advancing environmental management of a dynamic pollutant, which takes different forms in the atmospheric, aquatic, and terrestrial ecosystems. The research provides novel insights for developing an efficient multimedia pollution permit trading scheme with rules governing trades both within and between airborne and waterborne nitrogen emissions. The multidisciplinary nature of the research, which combines biogeochemistry, economics, biology, and social sciences, can lead to a coupled human-ecosystem-based approach for managing nitrogen pollution and connect ecological research results to human demands for ecosystem services and regulations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
