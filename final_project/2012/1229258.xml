    <AbstractNarration>1229258&lt;br/&gt;Gillikin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports acquisition of a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS) equipped with multiple collectors, a high temperature pyrolysis system and automated sample introduction system for the Geology Department at Union College. The instrument will support a range of research and research training in paleoclimatology and paleoceanography that requires analysis of stable isotope ratios recorded in marine and freshwater bivalves and in marine and lacustrine sediments. The instrument will also support isotopic investigations of natural waters, glacial ice and plant materials for paleoenvironmental and paleoecological studies of climate dynamics and the global carbon cycle. Union College in a non-Ph.D. granting institution and has a strong commitment to involving a diverse body of undergraduate students in faculty-mentored research. Union College is a member of the Keck Geology Consortium and the instrument will serve students and faculty from several affiliated Keck institutions. The PIs plans K-12 outreach activities aimed at at-risk and underrepresented youth for topical regional investigations of immediate societal relevance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
