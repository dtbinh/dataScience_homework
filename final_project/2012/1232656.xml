    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will use a cyber-learning tool to understand the relationship between the mathematical complexity of an engineering design problem and their cognitive complexity. An existing simulation game will be used to understand student design choices and relate them to students' knowledge, skills, values, and identity as an engineer. A detailed theoretical model can then be used to determine how various constructs of student understanding determines how they engage with engineering design problems. Design skills are fundamental to engineering work, thus a better understanding of the relationship between what students know and how they design can inform curricula and development of pedagogy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project is the exploration of cyber-learning simulations that have the potential to be scalable and customizable to different engineering degree programs. One of the potential advantages of using simulations to teach design thinking is the ability to address the needs of different groups to improve their retention in engineering degree programs. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.</AbstractNarration>
