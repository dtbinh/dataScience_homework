    <AbstractNarration>Communication between neurons in the brain occurs via synaptic transmission at chemical synapses, and tightly regulated release of neurotransmitter from activated to target neurons is required. Since the fundamental molecular mechanisms of transmitter release are conserved throughout evolution, molecular-genetic studies in fruit flies can be used to discover the mechanisms regulating release without the expense or ethical considerations of mammalian studies. Using molecular techniques to generate mutant transgenic Drosophila, Dr. Reist and colleagues will determine how the neuronal calcium-binding protein, synaptotagmin, regulates multiple types of neurotransmitter release: calcium-triggered synchronous and asynchronous release as well as spontaneous release. Actively adjusting the amount of transmitter released and the interplay between synchronous and asynchronous release are thought to be a key mechanisms mediating learning and memory. Thus, this work will provide critical mechanistic insights required for understanding how synaptic transmission is regulated in animals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies will contribute to a foundational and mechanistic basis for future translational studies aimed at improving neuronal communication in diseases of neural dysfunction, such as Alzheimer?s disease. All transgenic fly lines generated in this work will be made freely available to the scientific community; when accepted, lines will be sent to the Bloomington Stock Center (http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/). Other lines will be available via e-mail request. Dr. Reist has trained numerous female (and male) undergraduate and graduate students in molecular neuroscience, and the implementation of this project will provide continued training opportunities for U.S. students. In addition, Dr. Reist regularly participates in the International Brain Research Organization's visiting lecture team program (http://ibro.info/professional-development/vltp-courses/). She has taught students in China, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka about the molecular mechanisms of transmitter release. As such, these studies will directly contribute to educational outreach in developing nations.</AbstractNarration>
