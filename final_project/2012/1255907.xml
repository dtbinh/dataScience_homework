    <AbstractNarration>A great challenge for future electronic systems is coping with process, voltage, temperature and aging variations. If left unchecked these variations require unacceptable design margins, can lead to transient and permanent faults, and significantly degrade the system reliability and resilience. This project is to consider the potentially transformative concept of regular periodic deep rejuvenation for electronic systems akin to the recovery during sleep for biological systems. Until now sleep for electronics just meant a period of inactivity; this proposal explores the idea of sleep becoming an active recovery period as essential for electronics as it is in biology. Such deep rejuvenation schemes will require cross-layer optimizations in order to balance the various tradeoffs. Promising preliminary experimental results show the potential benefits of the proposed activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research, if successful, could have a deep impact on the semiconductor industry, and society as a whole, by the way electronic systems are designed, used and operated. Due to the periodic rejuvenation such systems could be optimized to run faster, consume less power, have less area, cost less, and thus overall provide more value per dollar. The Principle Investigator plans to develop a textbook for application-specific integrated circuits or systems-on-chips that would take advantage of the interactive graphics made possible by the iBook format, and to "flip" the classroom with the help of the available on-line lectures.</AbstractNarration>
