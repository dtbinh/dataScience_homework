    <AbstractNarration>This award will support a long-term comprehensive spectropolarimetric survey of all types of supernovae. The principal goal of this effort is to improve the understanding of the characteristics and importance of asymmetries in supernova explosions by focusing on the observable evolution. Polarimetry allows one to probe spatial scales in a supernova that cannot be resolved through direct imaging from earth or space. Spectropolarimetry further enhances the power of this technique by revealing wavelength dependent variations that may result from optical depth dependent geometries. In recent years, evidence has grown that nearly all supernovae exhibit departures from spherical symmetry. These results, together with advances in computing power that enable full three dimensional modeling, are exposing the possibility that asymmetries are not just observable consequences of supernovae, but may in fact be a necessity of the explosion mechanism itself. The investigators will obtain repeat spectropolarimetry of the brightest core collapse and thermonuclear. These data will be augmented with both photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to have an impact on astrophysics as the diagnostic power of polarimetry continues to advance, especially in the era of giant telescopes and time-variable astronomy. This project will also support a number of outreach and education efforts at each institution and will contribute to the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, Dr. Hoffman will continue her leadership of the Collaborative Research in Astrophysics (CORA) program at the University of Denver. This program is based on studies that show that participation in group research projects increases retention of female students in scientifically and technically demanding majors.</AbstractNarration>
