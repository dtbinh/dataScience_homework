    <AbstractNarration>This project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program (EPM) in the Division of Materials Research (DMR) and the Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetic Devices Program (EPMD) in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This project seeks to develop both rational synthetic methods and fundamental understanding of the electrical properties of complex metal oxide nanowires and their heterostructures with diameter below 10 nanometers for the potential applications in advanced nanoelectronics. It enables the experimental and theoretical investigation of ultra-thin ternary and quaternary complex metal oxide nanowires and their heterostructures, advancing the opportunities for the studies of electron transport in these unique platforms. Scientific issues to be addressed include materials synthesis, physical property characterizations, and multiscale modeling. The capability of rational design and scalable synthesis of nanowires with desirable size, morphology, and properties can significantly advance the innovation at the frontier of functional complex metal oxide-based nanoelectronics and provide a great potential for future large-scale device fabrication and deployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: The project addresses fundamental research issues in materials science and electronic devices. Success of the research can have significant impacts on not only complex metal oxide materials systems but also more broadly materials science and device physics. The educational goals of the project are accomplished through the development of interdisciplinary educational and training opportunities for graduate students and industrial experience via internships in industry through the existing collaboration between Purdue University and DuPont, which can also significantly benefit the transformative technology development of transparent thin film electronic devices based on large-scale assembly of complex metal oxide nanowires and their heterostructures on flexible plastic substrates. The research results will be integrated with undergraduate and graduate courses and serve as the basis for undergraduate design projects. Outreach activities to high school students, including students from underrepresented groups, are included in this project.</AbstractNarration>
