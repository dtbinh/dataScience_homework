    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this grant is to gain a detailed fundamental understanding of the complex interplay between the thermodynamics and kinetics governing early-stage surface-oxidation processes in single- and multi-oxidant environments. The study will use advanced high-resolution techniques to allow in situ interrogation of reaction-product interfaces for elucidating structural, chemical, and defect developments. Specifically, Ni, Ni-Cr, and, later, Ni-Cr-Al alloys in 700-1100¢ªC environments containing O2, H2O, CO2, or some combination of these as primary oxidants will be systematically examined. While the central focus is to establish science-based approaches for developing and/or improving advanced high-temperature alloys and coatings used in the many harsh environments found in practice, the scientific understanding gained will also contribute to elucidating the collective and coupled behaviors of surface reactions in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this interdisciplinary collaborative effort will lead to new paradigms in the important field of gas-solid surface reactions, such as corrosion, catalysis, sensors, fuel cells, and synthesis for a variety of electronic, magnetic, medical, and optical devices. The study will contribute to national economic competitiveness (novel materials and technologies created), development of a competitive STEM workforce (training and mentorship of graduate students and post-docs, interdisciplinary courses), the participation of women and underrepresented minorities; high school community outreach (Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science), and national security (sustainable energy, energy generation, enhanced aircraft design). Materials-related classes at all levels will be developed or modified in multiple departments driven by the need to introduce students to the latest developments in materials-centered research and technology. Examples of classes include Gas-Metal Reactions, Crystallography, Nanocharacterization, Transmission Electron Microscopy, and Introduction to Materials Science.</AbstractNarration>
