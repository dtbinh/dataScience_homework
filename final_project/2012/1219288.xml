    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;09 July 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1219288&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;PI: W. Byam&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: [None]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment item for the University of Delaware for the R/V HUGH R. SHARP; namely control system up-grades for the existing CTD Handling System. This award represents Phase I of a multi-year project award that will eventually support similar system up-grades on the University of Hawaii's KILO MOANA. This project will greatly enhance safety and science support capabilities on both vessels.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit: The PI addressed the Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit of the proposed equipment specifically for the R/V HUGH R. SHARP. The research projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit. During operations, these vessels routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. Specifically, College of Marine and Earth Studies participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house events (Coast Day), participation the MATE program, and educational cruises. The College also hosts the UNOLS East Coast Van Pool. The R/V HUGH R. SHARP is scheduled to support over 90 NSF-funded days in CY 2012.</AbstractNarration>
