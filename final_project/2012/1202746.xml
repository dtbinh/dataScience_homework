    <AbstractNarration>Biological and physical influences on ecosystem metabolism and nutrient uptake&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deciphering the interconnections between energy and nutrient resources and how they combine to influence nutrient uptake and ecosystem metabolism remains a grand challenge in the ecological sciences. Previous research has focused on static measures of these processes and limited information exists on the spatial and temporal variability of these dynamics. This project uses new methods and sensor technologies to decipher the dynamic interconnections between energy, nutrient resources, ecosystem metabolism, and nutrient uptake. Data across two zones of differing climate, vegetation, landforms, and ecology will allow for comparisons between regions. This research seeks new understanding of the coupled biological and physical influences on ecosystem metabolism and nutrient uptake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The postdoctoral fellow will develop advanced skills in measuring and modeling ecological and hydrological processes. The development of an inter-university field-based course will train students in the newly developed methods, technologies, and data analysis techniques. Interdisciplinary interactions at the Nicholas School of the Environment and the River Center will help expand this work beyond stream studies to aquatic ecosystems. Data generated from this research will be made publicly available through the hydrologic data sharing system, CUAHSI HIS, and interaction with local water quality groups will expand the impacts beyond the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
