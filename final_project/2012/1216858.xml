    <AbstractNarration>In a heterogeneous wireless network, interference has become the dominant performance limiting factor due to frequency sharing between the second tier low powered micro/pico/femto base stations and the high powered macro base stations. This project deals with several theoretical and practical aspects of interference management for the heterogeneous wireless networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will first identify the classes of interference management problems that are computationally intractable, and then show how well they can be approximately solved with a complexity that is polynomial in the problem size and the solution accuracy. Special emphasis is given to the distributed implementation of the proposed algorithms. A unified co-tier and cross-tier approach will be developed for joint user admission, user-base station association, power control, user grouping as well as transceiver design. Central to this study is to jointly optimize user-base station association, transmit/receive beamformers, user scheduling as well as partial joint transmission among a subset of base stations. The proposed approach will transform the interference management problem into an equivalent higher dimensional optimization problem and explore efficient update of iterates that can be decomposed across base stations, users and frequency slots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout this research, advanced optimization techniques will be the key to the development of various interference management algorithms. The methodologies developed in this research will provide effective means to mitigate interference in heterogeneous networks and significantly improve the network throughput as well as the users quality of service.</AbstractNarration>
