    <AbstractNarration>This project will provide the Phase 2 systems engineering for the Global Environment for Network &lt;br/&gt;Innovations (GENI) project. GENI, a virtual laboratory for exploring future internet technologies &lt;br/&gt;and protocols at scale, creates major opportunities to understand, innovate and transform &lt;br/&gt;global networks and their interactions with society. Via the flexible and dynamic deployment of &lt;br/&gt;experiments onto common infrastructure, GENI re-imagines the methodology of both network system &lt;br/&gt;research and of potential early deployments and evaluation. It enables repeatable experiments &lt;br/&gt;on large, complex, networked systems At scale demonstrations of transformational ideas &lt;br/&gt;increases the opportunity for significant socio-economic impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the GENI program it was not clear that GENI was technically feasible. An early major goal was to show &lt;br/&gt;its feasibility. To this end, the GPO started a series of rapid, community-created prototypes via ?spiral development? &lt;br/&gt;so that hands on experience could drive its evolution. Each GENI spiral is 12 months long, and aims to drive down &lt;br/&gt;specific technical and programmatic risks. This proposal supports the engineering activities of spirals 4, 5 and 6. &lt;br/&gt;The task categories associated with the proposal are:&lt;br/&gt;a) Experiment support and direct aid to the research teams attempting to use the GENI prototype, including training &lt;br/&gt;and tools.&lt;br/&gt;b) Continued progress towards full Integration and Operations of the current GENI prototype including &lt;br/&gt;deployment of GENI racks, enhancing the integration with Internet 2 and National Lambda Rail, additional &lt;br/&gt;WiMax integration, campus expansion with the goal of having between 100 to 200 campuses ?GENI enabled?, and &lt;br/&gt;transition for 24x7 operations managed by Indiana University.&lt;br/&gt;c) Formalization and documentation of the GENI architecture.&lt;br/&gt;d) Systems Engineering work including security analysis of the GENI infrastructure, instrumentation and &lt;br/&gt;measurement tools and infrastructure, and subcontract technical management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The engineering process of building GENI has directly engaged the newest generation of &lt;br/&gt;faculty in students in a large-scale systems project. The experience of building a large-scale system &lt;br/&gt;is an educational opportunity that is providing direct benefit to the US computer research community. GENI &lt;br/&gt;is already being used as an instrument for research. This proposal supports and broadens the availability &lt;br/&gt;and usability of the research instrument.</AbstractNarration>
