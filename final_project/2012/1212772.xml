    <AbstractNarration>R/V New Horizon will be operating along the West Coast of the United States during 2012, primarily in and out of San Diego. However, the vessel will transit to Newport Oregon to support work funded by the Navy as well as NSF. NSF-funded scientific objectives supported by cruises on R/V New Horizon in 2012 include: Marine Geology and Geophysics in support of the Cascadia Initiative; Biological Oceanography is support of the California Current Ecosystem Long-Term Ecological Research project; Instrumentation development in support of pressure sensors for ocean observatories as well as a Carbon Flux Explorer Development project; and a UNOLS training program for new chief scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R/V New Horizon is well suited to support these programs in terms of equipment and crew experience. This proposal represents year one of a five year renewed cooperative agreement. The amount of the award in out-years on this agreement will be negotiated yearly, and is dependent on the number of days at sea in support of NSF funded research programs. Scripps Institution of Oceanography executed the previous cooperative agreement (0505770) very well, meeting all requirements for performance and reporting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed work is indirect. It derives from the intellectual merit of the individual research projects that depend upon the shipboard work at sea. NSF-funded scientific investigations for 2012 operations include: marine geology; seismic hazard studies; climate observations; and instrumentation development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The mission of R/V Horizon includes the provision of educational opportunities both to students of the marine sciences, and, through educational outreach. R/V New Horizon operations also contribute significantly to a wide diversity of scientific disciplines, the data from which benefit oceanographic research beyond those studies directly funded to participate in cruises.</AbstractNarration>
