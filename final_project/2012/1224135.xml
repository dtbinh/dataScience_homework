    <AbstractNarration>This two year full scale development project builds on a proof of concept EAGER award. The EAGER award resulted in web-based summaries of peer reviewed STEM education research articles for ISE professionals. The project team will make field-requested adjustments to the Relating Research to Practice (RR2P) Web Resource for ISE Professionals; implement two workshops; and produce 200 briefs and 25-30 synthesis papers. The team members will work closely with CAISE regarding selection of research papers and topics of new synthesis papers. CAISE will make available the synthesis papers during convenings, forums, and other events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RR2P will help build capacity across the ISE field by bringing research to ISE educators, administrators, and others in an accessible manner as well as involving ISE practitioners in the process of selecting topics of interest for the briefs and papers and the manner in which content is disseminated. The project deliverables have potential for building capacity across the ISE field in terms of increasing awareness and understanding of research-based discoveries and increasing effectiveness of teaching and learning.</AbstractNarration>
