    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemistry Division and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Professors Lisa McElwee-White and Tim Anderson of the University of Florida will work with Dr. Gary S. Silverman of Arkema Inc. on a vertically integrated approach to developing chemistries for cost-effective and scalable chemical vapor deposition of tungsten oxide injection layers for organic optoelectronic devices. The researchers use mechanism-based precursor design accompanied by computational chemistry tools to evaluate potential precursors before synthesis. Synthesis of the precursors is followed by a rapid screening process that sends only the most promising precursors to the film demonstration step. Aalternative precursor delivery systems designed for all molecules independent of volatility are also considered, thus including the full range of possible precursors. Close collaboration with industry will facilitate process development and optimization including reactor modeling, thus increasing the likelihood of successful technology transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together collaborators with complementary chemistry, chemical engineering, materials and industrial process development expertise to address a critical problem in the manufacture of organic optoelectronic devices. The target application is OLED devices for general illumination, which have the potential for significant energy savings. Through working on an interdisciplinary project involving academic-industrial collaboration, students will gain exposure to team-based training and problem solving skills that reach outside their own disciplines of graduate study. Six-month internships at the Arkema site will give students exposure to industrial practice that will broaden their perspectives beyond academic research. In addition, participating faculty will have the opportunity to integrate their added insight from industrial collaboration into their courses.</AbstractNarration>
