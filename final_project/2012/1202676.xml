    <AbstractNarration>Exploring the relative importance of biotic and environmental sources of selection for pine-fungal interactions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research that considers mechanisms by which plants evolve in response to complex environments including mutualists, enemies, and variable environmental factors is important for understanding what the most important selective factors are in driving trait evolution in plants. Interactions among plant hosts and their diverse associated microbes may provide an ecologically unique arena in which to examine the nature of selection in multispecies interactions. In particular, interactions between coniferous plants and their associated microbes provide a good system for experiments exploring the relative importance of sources of selection, as conifers interact with a suite of belowground microorganisms, and these interactions vary along environmental gradients. Using experimental approaches, this research will investigate the evolutionary dynamics of traits surrounding the interaction among plants, enemies and mutualists under changing environmental conditions. Novel field estimates of selection will be conducted and key predictions of coevolutionary theory will be tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include developing expertise in statistical, empirical and analytical techniques. Career enhancement activities comprise the development of a unique research program including developing skills related to publication and presentation of research. The broader impacts of this project include training for underrepresented undergraduates in research skills such as field collection, molecular work, statistics and scientific presentation. Finally, while Monterey pine is considered threatened in its native range, it is widely cultivated as a plantation timber species in many temperate parts of the world so research which considers its response to changes in biotic and abiotic selection forces will inform both conservation and agricultural practices.</AbstractNarration>
