    <AbstractNarration>The award provides support to defray the expenses of US participants in "The Corona Problem: Connections between Operator Theory, Function Theory and Geometry", which will be held June 18-22, 2012, at the Fields Institute for Research in the Mathematical Sciences in Toronto (Canada). The Corona Problem is a fundamental question in complex analysis that has connections with operator theory, function theory and geometry. A version of the problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a collection of bounded analytic functions on a domain to generate the whole algebra as an ideal. Even though it is an abstract mathematical question, this problem has found interesting connections with questions in engineering via control theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF funding for this conference will be used to pay for the expenses of US based participant support, with priority given to graduate students, post-docs, younger faculty, members of underrepresented groups, and those without their own source of funding. This meeting will bring together researchers in operator theory, function theory, complex geometry and several complex variables to discuss recent advances related to Corona Problem and in particular the overlap between these areas of analysis. The workshop will be an opportunity to attract some of the leading experts in function theory, several complex variables and harmonic analysis together to discuss this question and related research questions of interest. This workshop will create an environment in which students and early career researchers could profit from the interaction with such top experts.</AbstractNarration>
