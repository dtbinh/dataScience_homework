    <AbstractNarration>Professor Peter H. Dinolfo from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is supported by a CAREER award from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms B program in the NSF Chemistry Division to study the photo- and electro-chemical properties of molecular donor-acceptor systems at electrode interfaces. The design of multilayer materials for specific electronic, photonic, or electro-optical applications requires an accurate knowledge of the structural-functional relationships of the films and their respective building blocks. Using a new layer-by-layer assembly technique developed in the PI's laboratory, multilayer films comprised of spectrally-tuned organic and inorganic chromophores will be assembled in donor-acceptor configurations on electrode surfaces. Spectroscopic and electrochemical methods will be applied to the modified substrates to elucidate the mechanisms and efficiency of energy and electron transfer processes between chromophore layers. This information will then be correlated with structural data on the multilayer thin films to determine the optimal conditions for creating efficient molecular-based light harvesting arrays for use in p-type dye-sensitized semiconductor solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing adaptable methods to chemically modify electrode and semiconductor surfaces with hierarchical molecular structures and understanding the photophysical processes occurring amongst the molecular constituents is of central importance to the field of artificial photosynthesis. This research will help formulate the design principles necessary to improve the efficiency of next generation molecular based solar cells and artificial photosynthetic devices. The project will also provide training for a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students in the interdisciplinary field of materials chemistry. Additionally, in an effort to stimulate and encourage young students to consider a career in one of the STEM fields, the PI will organize and run a week-long workshop for local high school students. These students will participate in several hands-on activities in the PI's laboratory at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute that are designed to highlight some of the basic chemical aspects of solar energy conversion and artificial photosynthesis.</AbstractNarration>
