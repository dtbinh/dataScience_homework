    <AbstractNarration>It is proposed that a carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen (CHNSO) elemental determinator be procured to augment the chemistry analytical instrument suite presently in use for research and instruction at Kettering University. Kettering University, formerly known as General Motors Institute is located in Flint, Michigan and is a non-PhD granting institution that specializes in cooperative education and experiential learning in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields. A CHNSO elemental determinator, if awarded, would be used by a multidisciplinary group of faculty in the Biochemistry, Chemistry, and Chemical Engineering programs engaged in applied and fundamental research in a wide variety of areas including alternative energy, organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and materials research. The investigators in these programs employ and mentor undergraduate students to aid in their research efforts. For some students, this work is incorporated into their undergraduate thesis. In addition, many students become coauthors on peer reviewed publications and/or presentations at local, regional, and national meetings. In addition to supporting student/faculty research, a CHNSO would enhance the educational mission of the department by broadening the educational background of junior- and senior-level chemistry and chemical engineering students.</AbstractNarration>
