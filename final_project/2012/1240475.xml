    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support to defray expenses of US participants attending the International Workshop in Operator Theory and Applications (IWOTA), to be held at the University of South Wales, in Sydney, Australia, during July 16-20, 2012. This project will fund participation of approximately twelve junior operator theorists from the United States who do not have support from other sources. Priority for funding will go to women and members of groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past 30 years, IWOTA has brought together mathematicians working in a variety of fields that share operator theory as a common theme. This will be twentieth meeting of IWOTA and the first time it will be held in Australia. The main themes of this workshop will be operator algebras, control theory, and harmonic analysis of differential operators. Due to the diversity of topics covered in IWOTA, the speakers are encouraged to give talks accessible to a general audience of analysts. This makes the meeting particularly useful for graduate students, postdocs, and junior mathematicians; the meeting also creates the perfect atmosphere for stimulating collaborations. The list of invited speakers will include world experts in operator theory and its applications; the list of participants will include junior researchers and postdocs from the United States, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. The program will provide ample time for contributed talks and informal discussions. The award provides a very good opportunity for young mathematicians with research interests in the area of operator theory, broadly defined, to be exposed to the latest developments in several related fields, to interact with researchers from other countries, and to possibly initiate future collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
