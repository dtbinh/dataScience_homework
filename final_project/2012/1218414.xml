    <AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Continued technological development depends on the advanced understanding of phenomena specific to nanoscale systems, and the ability to harness the phenomena for application in nanodevices. The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development project at West Virginia University is to explore new physical phenomena in nanoscale magnetic devices. Such devices promise higher speed and smaller power consumption compared to the conventional semiconductor devices. The functionality of nanomagnetic devices is associated with changes of their magnetic configuration, which can be efficiently achieved by passing an electrical current through the device. The goal of this project is to establish the scope of current-induced phenomena in nanomagnetic devices. The project will investigate whether using advanced magnetic materials with complex magnetic properties can enhance the efficiency of manipulation of magnetic nanodevices by electrical current. Additionally, new current-induced effects in magnetic devices will be probed, expanding the range of configurations achievable by applying an electrical current. The research goals of the project will be complemented by a comprehensive nanoscience education program, which includes a science camp for middle school students and development of a nanoscale physics course in the framework of the nanoscience minor at WVU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Future technological development relies on the advanced understanding of phenomena specific to nanoscale systems, and the ability to harness the phenomena for application in nanodevices. Magnetic nanodevices are a promising replacement for the conventional semiconductor devices. Their configuration can be manipulated by spin polarized electrical currents, which can rotate the magnetic moments via the spin transfer torque exerted by polarized electrons. The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development project at West Virginia University is to explore new current-induced phenomena in nanomagnetic devices that can make the manipulation of magnetic devices by current more efficient. The project will address the possibility of expanding the scope of manipulation by spin transfer to complex magnetic systems including antiferromagnets, and to magnetic configurations in which the usual spin torque becomes inefficient. The research goals of the project will be complemented by a comprehensive nanoscience education program, which includes a science camp for middle school students and development of a nanoscale physics course in the framework of the nanoscience minor at WVU.</AbstractNarration>
