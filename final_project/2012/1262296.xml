    <AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to Rice University that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013-2015. The program focuses on biological networks, complex interactions among biomolecules that give rise to the diverse biological phenotypes observed in nature. Students will work on research projects under faculty mentors that draw from a range of approaches (classical biochemical and genetic to non-trivial theoretical models that require computation) to study naturally-occurring genetic networks, artificial genetic and metabolic networks, and biomolecular structure, function, and evolution. Faculty with biological interests in diverse departments will serve as mentors, including professors within the Departments of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology, Bioengineering, Chemical &amp; Biomolecular Engineering, Chemistry, Computer Science, and Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology. Students are expected to do full-time lab research as well as participate in seminars and workshops that focus on responsible conduct in research, professional communication skills, career opportunities, and the graduate school application process. Students are also provided a creative opportunity to develop innovative biotechnological ideas and a capstone research poster symposium. Students will be recruited nationwide, with particular emphasis on students enrolled at proximal minority-serving two- and four-year institutions. Selection of students will be done based on the faculty steering committee?s evaluation of each applicant?s transcript and recommendation letters. Rice?s Institute of Biosciences and Bioengineering (IBB) administers this NSF REU Program and maintains a database of all the alumni for this program with tracking information on their career progression. Assessment of this program is done via pre- and post-questionnaires as well by using the common assessment tool available to BIO-funded REU PIs. Each year, IBB publishes a ?Class Notes? newsletter of the NSF REU alumni and features news on their current academic or professional status and accomplishments. More information is available by visiting the IBB website (http://ibb.rice.edu/Content.aspx?id=563) or by contacting the PI (Dr. George Bennett at gbennett@rice.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Joff Silberg at joff@rice.edu).</AbstractNarration>
