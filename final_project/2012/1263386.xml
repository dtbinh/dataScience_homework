    <AbstractNarration>The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site project has the objectives to engage undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research that advances the state-of-the-art for creating interactive virtual experiences, with a particular focus in human-computer interaction, computer graphics, and virtual humans. Hosted by the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT), students are immersed in a unique multidisciplinary community that combines academic researchers in computer science, psychology, communications, and medicine with the creative talents of Hollywood and the video game industry. The techniques and technologies advanced by ICT research projects drive the creation of compelling virtual reality environments and characters with immediate relevance to a broad range of application domains including training, education, rehabilitation, medicine, and entertainment. During the 10-week summer experience, students are also involved in weekly seminars to provide training in research methodology and the process of applying to graduate school, along with biweekly interactive workshops for team building and mentorship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The undergraduate student cohorts are composed of a diverse palette of interdisciplinary backgrounds reflecting the multifaceted culture of the institute, with a particular emphasis on selecting individuals from underrepresented groups in computing and institutions with limited STEM research opportunities. By engaging these students in interdisciplinary research and better preparing them for graduate school, this project has the potential to broaden participation from underrepresented populations and increase enrollment and retention in graduate programs in computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information about this project can be found at the REU Site webpage (http://ict.usc.edu/reu/).</AbstractNarration>
