    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop a set of algorithms to optimize the operation of an electric power distribution network incorporating demand response practices in combination with solar photovoltaics and energy storage technologies to absorb the new crop of electric vehicles (EVs). The approach is to apply the traditional knowledge of electric power distribution system analysis, together with agent-based technologies and mathematical models of various supply/demand devices, to address EV penetration challenges at the distribution feeder level.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit - The proposed algorithms are expected to potentially modernize current practices of electric power distribution network operation by contributing to load factor improvement and allowing EVs to interface with the grid without adding new peaks. Additional major contributions lie in the methodology to analyze and quantify demand response potentials, as well as the approach to quantify values of solar photovoltaics and storage to mitigate the impact of growing EV penetration. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts - The proposed algorithms will contribute greatly to a more efficient operation of the electric power distribution network. It will allow electric distribution companies to manage end-use demand without compromising customers? way of life, while avoiding/deferring extensive upgrades of transformers and switchgears with the large-scale penetration of EVs. Regulators and policy makers can make use of the research outcome to decide what technology combination makes sense in mitigating growing EV penetration. The research outcome will also contribute to the development of a demand response laboratory at Virginia Tech, which will broaden student exposure beyond the academic environment.</AbstractNarration>
