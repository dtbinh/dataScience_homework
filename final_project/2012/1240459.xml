    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI) Origami Design for the Integration of Self-Assembling Systems for Engineering Innovation (ODISSEI) award is to develop methods to design origami structures that actively fold from an initially flat sheet to complex three-dimensional shapes in response to multiple fields (e.g., electric, thermal, magnetic). They will also actively unfold, in contrast to current origami structures that must be manually unfolded. These multi-field responsive origami shapes will be developed through collaboration with a visual artist and approximated and modeled using geometric modeling and &lt;br/&gt;origami mathematics. The artistically inspired shapes will provide targets for designing novel active compliant mechanisms, which along with predictive multi-scale modeling and multi-physics simulations, will guide the development of new active materials. This new class of multi-field responsive materials includes micro- and nano-enabled hybrids where a graded distribution of particles enables coupling between multiple external fields to allow selective folding and unfolding along creases. A design optimization framework will be developed to integrate the modeling, design, and active materials efforts and enable system trade studies from the nano to the macro scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project will foster novel concepts and design innovation in several application areas. For example, origami-based surgical instruments will benefit minimally invasive surgery, where there is a need for mm-scale devices that can deploy inside the body to manipulate tissue. Similarly, origami-based adaptive aircraft structures, reconfigurable robots, and deployable space structures will help enhance mission versatility. A summer student exchange program and multi-university capstone design projects among Penn State, Rowan, and George Mason will help broaden participation of under-represented groups in engineering &lt;br/&gt;and STEM majors. The research will also be leveraged to create interactive artistic pieces and K-12-targeted workshops for the Discovery Space Museum in State College, PA and Penn State's Palmer Museum of Art.</AbstractNarration>
