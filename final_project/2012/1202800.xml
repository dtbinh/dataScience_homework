    <AbstractNarration>Climatic and hydrologic influences on tree regeneration and distribution in the western United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though rapid climate change is widely recognized as a major threat to ecosystem stability, there is little agreement about how resilient species and communities will be to future conditions. The consequences of climate changes will be particularly pronounced for dry-region ecosystems such as forests of the western US due to strong elevation and climatic gradients. Predicting patterns of tree species regeneration will be central to understanding the impact of climate change on western forests. This research will examine the climatic and hydrologic limitations on tree reproduction, and ultimately the limitations on tree distributions, in the western US by developing a statistical framework for assimilating diverse, publicly-available datasets across space and time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fellow will be mentored by Dr. William Lauenroth, an expert in semiarid plant community dynamics, and Dr. Andrew Finely, an ecologist and statistical modeler. This project stresses the interdisciplinary nature needed to address pressing issues such as the influence of global change on species distribution and the development of methods for utilizing extensive, publicly-available datasets. The research benefits society by identifying tree species with the greatest risk of local and regional population decline as well as highlighting geographic areas where tree regeneration is likely to fail under future predicted climate regimes. This information will help guide land managers and policymakers in managing forests on public and private lands across the western US.</AbstractNarration>
