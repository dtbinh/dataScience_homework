    <AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to improve power density in&lt;br/&gt;power electronics, while lowering the economic hurdles keeping students from participating in this&lt;br/&gt;field. The approach is to make efficient switching power converters with frequencies at least ten times&lt;br/&gt;higher than conventional designs with no magnetic materials and small-valued capacitors. Resulting&lt;br/&gt;designs will have all passive components embedded in an inexpensive circuit board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Recent advances in power density have been mostly due to improved semiconductors&lt;br/&gt;that switch faster but these advances are reaching a plateau when used in conventional circuit&lt;br/&gt;designs. This is due to frequency-dependent losses in semiconductors and in energy storage devices.&lt;br/&gt;This research looks to implement a value-added strategy using inexpensive printed circuit boards by&lt;br/&gt;fabricating all passive devices with conductive traces, transforming the printed circuit board into a&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional resonant structure. This will eliminate post-fabrication tuning and component variation&lt;br/&gt;while maintaining extraordinary levels of performance at reduced cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: To enhance outreach, educational modules on resonant power converters tied to the&lt;br/&gt;research outcomes will engage students and increase access to this developing field. This coursework is&lt;br/&gt;rarely available to students, specially Hispanic, who will be a particular focus of the proposed outreach.&lt;br/&gt;The program will follow the approach of: dramatically enhance the power electronics curriculum at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan, employ educational outreach to encourage Hispanic students to learn power&lt;br/&gt;electronics, and use low-cost technologies to make the design and fabrication of resonant converters&lt;br/&gt;available to a wider public.</AbstractNarration>
