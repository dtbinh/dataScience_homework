    <AbstractNarration>This Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) project brings together major companies and universities in the development of a wireless communications ecosystem to commercialize breakthrough technologies that promise to increase the capacity of today's wireless cellular networks by over 1000 times. Specifically, three existing technologies will be relied upon to create a prototype stage for integration by wireless handset makers and infrastructure providers as well as incorporation into next-generation cellular standards. These technologies are: (i) millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular systems that can move cellular communication to new bands between 20 and 120 GHz where between 50 and 100 times more spectrum are readily available; (ii) relaying and distributed coordination techniques to enable ultra low-cost small, self-organizing cells that increase the numbers of cell sites by orders of magnitude; and (iii) full duplex communication that can double communication bandwidth and facilitate beamforming techniques essential for mmWave cellular systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the enormous market size of the cellular industry ($1 trillion worldwide), combined with the pressing need for solutions to solve the spectrum crunch, the breakthrough technologies in this proposal will offer tremendous market value, return on investment, and opportunities for employment. This AIR project provides a path for both industry and academia to develop key products and knowledge that will impact the standard-setting process of the wireless industry, while bringing massive increases in data throughputs to cellular networks throughout the U.S.</AbstractNarration>
