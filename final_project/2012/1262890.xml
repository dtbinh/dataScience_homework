    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at Louisiana State University. The intended impact of this program is fostering interest in careers in science, by introducing students to the nature of research-oriented careers in physics and astronomy and by developing research-related skills and knowledge. REU students are recruited nationally; students can be of any academic year and need not have a declared major, but must have completed the general physics sequence at their school. For the ten-week program, the participants will be matched with faculty mentors based on student interests. Students will join their mentors in active research projects, such as: &lt;br/&gt;- performing analysis on data from the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment T2K;&lt;br/&gt;- simulating black holes and supernova explosions on the nation's fastest supercomputers, to determine their visibility in gravitational, electromagnetic, and neutrino detectors; and&lt;br/&gt;- designing quantum error correction codes and quantum memory for photonic qubits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weekly seminars and workshops introduce the students to faculty research, to skills development, to common research resources, and to professional development topics such as ethics and patents/intellectual property. Students participate in field trips and other activities, some of which are coordinated with concurrent LSU summer science programs in computer science, biomedical science and other areas. Students from all programs are lodged in proximity at on-campus apartment-style housing, to foster group interactions and a sense of community.</AbstractNarration>
