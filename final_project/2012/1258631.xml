    <AbstractNarration>This project builds on fundamental research about an innovative pedagogical tool, moving that tool toward being an attractive, reliable, commercially-viable product available to educators worldwide. This project determines the optimal path for transitioning the tool to a greater market. The tool has been shown to have a positive effect on improving learning in undergraduate STEM courses and elsewhere. With broad theoretical foundations, technology-enabled tool provides revealing glimpses into how students think as they struggle to master new material. These insights into how students learn STEM concepts and processes could have far-reaching implications in educational research and classroom practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This discipline-independent pedagogical tool allows inclusive classroom communication, blind to student gender, ethnicity, disability, age or skill level, and encourages otherwise reluctant participants to be more actively engaged in the classroom, even with larger (&gt;60) enrollments. By implementing classroom practices that embody what is known about how students learn, actively engaging students in higher-level thinking skills, and informing instruction, use of the product will help create a workforce better prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century.</AbstractNarration>
