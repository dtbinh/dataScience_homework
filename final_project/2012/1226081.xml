    <AbstractNarration>This project proposes to make significant improvements to WeBWorK's NPL, and build a community of faculty around the country to maintain and curate the future role of the NPL (National Public Library), which is a collection of over 25,000 homework problems that are distributed with WeBWorK. WeBWorK, a web-based homework system used by over 300 schools, is an open-source system, developed and maintained by mathematicians. It is supported by the Mathematics Association of America (MAA). Additional outcomes of the project are improving the organization of NPL problems and developing software tools to facilitate easy access to the NPL. Upon completion, mathematics instructors will be able to search the library more easily for problems of the type they want. Both the NPL and the accompanying software promote the improvement of teaching and enhance the infrastructure for education in mathematics. Moreover, the project fosters mathematics faculty development by making a new tool accessible for effective mathematics teaching.</AbstractNarration>
