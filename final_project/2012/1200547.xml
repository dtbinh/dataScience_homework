    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this grant is to determine the atomic-scale mechanisms responsible for high-temperature surface stability of catalytically-active transition-metal oxides such as titanium dioxide (TiO2). Since catalytic performance depends critically on the surface atomic structure and composition, a stable surface with desired stoichiometry is critical for superior lifetime performance. Relatively little is known concerning the effect of gas chemistry on high-temperature surface composition and defect structure of TiO2. This investigation will use in situ high-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and low-energy electron microscopy techniques and establish the dynamics of surface morphological, structural, and compositional evolution on rutile-structured TiO2(110).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research program will lead to the development of high-performance transition-metal oxide catalysts and catalyst support materials, thermophotovoltaics, and other devices. The project will encourage the participation of underrepresented students and promote awareness among high-school students to pursue higher education in science and engineering at UCLA. Research results will be integrated into courses for the benefit of students and disseminated through presentations and publications. A focused session emphasizing in situ microscopy studies of surface and interface dynamics will be organized to enhance awareness about this topic.</AbstractNarration>
