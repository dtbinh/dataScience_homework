    <AbstractNarration>This project builds on the results and findings of the previously funded Robotics Corridor Collaborative Project (0603427), which demonstrated that after school robotics and math programming is highly successful in motivating high school students to pursue technical and engineering studies. Yet once students who participate in such programming graduate from high schools and enroll in post-secondary institutions, they often lose interest and drop out due to lack of adequate support. The primary deliverable of this project is a pre-engineering experience, coursework, and project based instruction that includes strong, technical training with additional math preparation, enabling high school students to successfully pursue post-secondary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) studies as soon as they arrive in college rather than being delayed by remedial coursework. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has five goals: (1) provide training for incumbent workers and professional development for teachers who work with students; (2) increase the number of students pursuing technical and engineering degrees upon graduation from high school; (3) reduce the need for remedial math coursework among students matriculating from high school to the college; (4) increase the number of post-secondary students successfully completing technical and engineering degrees or certificates at the college; and (5) develop 2+2+2 articulation agreements with school districts and four-year institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary target population consists of at risk and underrepresented Cleveland Metropolitan School District high school students and community college students. The project involves enrollment of Cleveland students in coursework and after school activities that include math, robot programming, work readiness training, and other technical training. These high school and college students are being taught and mentored by high school teachers and industry experts hired as college faculty and mentored and tutored by student mentors from the college. Students also participate in a summer camp developed by the college, Kent State University, and VisualEdge. The project is mapping out a clear pathway for students to follow in pursuing their technical and engineering degrees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Building on the findings of prior work, this project is improving STEM education for underrepresented students and providing them with a strong support system to ensure their successful completion of post-secondary STEM education and entry into the engineering and engineering technology workforce. The project has the potential to be a student success model for underrepresented youth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The college has a track record of working with a diverse cross section of society, especially with underrepresented and at risk urban populations. Industry representatives participate in the advisory board that helps develop curriculum for training students in the transferable work skills required in technical jobs. Project results and findings are being shared with colleagues at regional and national conferences and on the project web site.</AbstractNarration>
