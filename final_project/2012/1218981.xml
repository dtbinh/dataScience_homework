    <AbstractNarration>Researchers and decision makers in diverse fields such as &lt;br/&gt;fraud detection, genome sequencing, and datacenter&lt;br/&gt;management need to process many terabytes of data every day. &lt;br/&gt;Many fields are turning to MapReduce systems to process such &lt;br/&gt;growing datasets. Consequently, the relatively young MapReduce&lt;br/&gt;ecosystem has to support complex workloads that include &lt;br/&gt;declarative queries for report generation, MapReduce &lt;br/&gt;programs for machine learning tasks, and large job workflows.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, elastic and pay-as-you-go cloud platforms pose novel &lt;br/&gt;challenges and opportunities for MapReduce workload management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is building the Hadoop AutoAdmin system for &lt;br/&gt;automating MapReduce workload management. To the PI's knowledge, &lt;br/&gt;Hadoop AutoAdmin is the first system to address this challenging &lt;br/&gt;problem that will become increasingly important as a broad class &lt;br/&gt;of users adopt MapReduce. Hadoop AutoAdmin has three research &lt;br/&gt;thrusts. The first thrust is to understand and characterize the &lt;br/&gt;behavior of MapReduce workloads based on a comprehensive empirical &lt;br/&gt;study involving workloads and data from multiple application domains &lt;br/&gt;as well as different cluster configurations on the cloud. The second &lt;br/&gt;thrust is to develop an easy-to-use and efficient warehouse to &lt;br/&gt;store, retrieve, and visualize the diverse forms of workload &lt;br/&gt;monitoring data. The models and insights from these activities will &lt;br/&gt;drive the third thrust of developing end-to-end algorithms for &lt;br/&gt;workload management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project can have significant impact in areas of national &lt;br/&gt;importance like security and healthcare that are inundated with &lt;br/&gt;data. Hadoop AutoAdmin will improve worker productivity, system &lt;br/&gt;utilization, and cost-effectiveness of cloud platforms. The &lt;br/&gt;technical contributions will be disseminated broadly and the &lt;br/&gt;system released publicly.</AbstractNarration>
