    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes the commercialization of a&lt;br/&gt;new type of industrial refrigeration system for cooling raw milk in Indian villages, without the&lt;br/&gt;use of backup diesel generators. The innovation lies in a novel thermal battery pack concept&lt;br/&gt;developed by Promethean Power Systems with a Phase I grant from the National Science&lt;br/&gt;Foundation. The battery solves a chronic unreliable electricity problem by converting and&lt;br/&gt;storing electrical energy in the form of thermal energy through a process of freezing and melting&lt;br/&gt;a material. The battery needs just five hours of grid electricity to charge and, once charged,&lt;br/&gt;provides constant cooling power on demand when the grid is off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the introduction of clean energy&lt;br/&gt;technologies in refrigeration applications, eliminating costly spoilage of foods and providing&lt;br/&gt;clean energy alternatives to developing economies that currently rely on fossil-based fuels for&lt;br/&gt;their continued growth. In developing countries, billions of dollars of perishable foods are&lt;br/&gt;wasted annually because of inadequate cold-chain supply networks. A major obstacle in setting&lt;br/&gt;up a cold-chain network is the lack of reliable grid electricity to run refrigeration systems in&lt;br/&gt;villages and farming areas. In such conditions, diesel generators are often used as backup, a nonideal&lt;br/&gt;solution with high cost and environmental impact. Promethean?s thermal battery eliminates&lt;br/&gt;diesel generators and makes village refrigeration systems economically viable. This could&lt;br/&gt;revolutionize dairy industries around the world, especially in India, the largest producer and&lt;br/&gt;consumer of milk in the world, where nearly 400 million people depend on milk for their daily&lt;br/&gt;protein. Although Promethean?s first commercialization efforts are in India where thermal&lt;br/&gt;batteries are needed the most, these efforts will benefit US economy by providing a large and&lt;br/&gt;growing market to US products and affirming America?s leading role in spreading innovative&lt;br/&gt;ideas throughout the world.</AbstractNarration>
