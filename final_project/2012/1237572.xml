    <AbstractNarration>The University of Pittsburgh in conjunction with the American Association for the Advancement of Scien(AAAS) will design a Train the Trainers of Trainers (T3) model based on some of the leading research of Everett Rogers and others about how .innovations are diffused into existing organizations. T3 will ramp up the training of faculty to train others who train graduate students in responsible conduct of research, conduct research and interviews to gather knowledge about what has worked to date, plan the workshop for training the trainers, develop workshop materials that address issues of pedagogy, program implementation including, the development of support for ethics training, and design new curricula units that relate to professional development issues that arise unexpectedly, but are critical to the professional and ethical success of the graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;The proposal addresses a critically important need across all STEM fields?the training in responsible conduct of research and ethical behavior throughout a STEM career. The model will rapidly multiply the number of people capable of teaching ethics to STEM graduate students with new workshops, curricula and websites. &lt;br/&gt;The collaboration with AAAS and other professional societies augurs well for a fast and useful ramp-up of materials and usage. While the project focuses on graduate students in NSF related fields, it is anticipated that the curriculum materials and training will be useful for teaching ethics to undergraduates, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty, and staff in fields beyond those that are NSF related.</AbstractNarration>
