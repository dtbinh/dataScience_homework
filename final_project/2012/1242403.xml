    <AbstractNarration>This award will partially support the 6th Graduate Climate Conference at the University of Washington from October 26-28, 2012. Specifically, the award will be used to support the travel, meals and lodging costs for 30 US graduate students to participate in the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Graduate Climate Conference is an annual event that provides students with a discussion forum on all topics of climate change research - including atmospheric, biological, earth and ocean sciences - and allows the students to see how their own research fits into this breadth of climate research activities. The workshop provides a relaxed environment for interactions with individuals at a similar early career stage and the opportunity to develop a network of collaborative, interdisciplinary relationships that will prove beneficial throughout their careers.</AbstractNarration>
