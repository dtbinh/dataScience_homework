    <AbstractNarration>The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)proposes to continue the on-line publication of Icelights--a sub-site of the NSIDC Arctic Sea Ice News &amp; Analysis website--which offers scientifically accurate articles, created to be accessible to the general reader, that help NSIDC interact more directly with the public on issues related to Arctic sea-ice extent and trends and to respond directly to the public inquiries on timely scientific topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal aims to achieve several specific, and measurable, goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? To continue the on-line publication of Icelights.&lt;br/&gt;? To increase the frequency of Icelights posts per month to an average of 2 to 4 from the current 1 to 2 per month.&lt;br/&gt;? To launch a series of special posts on the site, including blogging from scientific conferences where sea-ice topics are discussed, such as the American Geophysical Union?s annual meeting. And to launch a series of ?guest posts? open to scientists or science bloggers.&lt;br/&gt;? To increase the amount of two-way communications with readers of the site, including the general public, but also members of the traditional news media and the ?blogosphere.?</AbstractNarration>
