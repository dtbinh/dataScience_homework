    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of the workshop are to provide a platform for discussing the state-of-the-art of computational modeling of cementitious materials at multiscale levels and identifying the gap in creating a comprehensive and predictive model linking chemistry, microstructure, and mechanical properties across length and time scales. The two-day workshop will bring together researchers from US, Europe, Canada, and Japan in areas of computational mechanics, materials science, and chemistry. The workshop covers six topics, from atomistic modeling, chemical kinetics and microstructure prediction methods, multi-phase reactive transport models, mechanical property prediction, thermo-chemo-mechanical coupling methods, and multiscale computational principles and bridging methods. The outcome of the workshop will identify research needs to achieve next generation of cementitious systems, opening the door to a new paradigm of ?concrete-by-design?.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will provide forum for world?s leading experts to exchange, debate and assess the state of knowledge of computational modeling of cementitious materials. Researchers from multiple disciplines in engineering and science fields will be engaged, and global collaborations will be stimulated. Also the workshop will engage young researchers in this new and dynamic field and will provide them with leadership experience. Graduate students will have the opportunity interacting with international students attending the workshop. The workshop will be broadcast over the internet and questions will be placed to message board.</AbstractNarration>
