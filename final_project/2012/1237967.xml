    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The 2012 FASEB meeting on Yeast Chromosome Structure, Replication and Segregation will be held July 15-20, 2012 in at the Steamboat Grand Resort in Steamboat Springs, CO. The meeting is unique in that it brings together scientists doing basic research involving chromosome behavior in two yeast models, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The meeting covers a wide range of topics, including: DNA replication, chromosome structure and evolution, chromatin structure and gene expression, telomeres and silencing, recombination and chromosome rearrangements, mitosis and meiosis, cell cycle regulation, kintechores, spindles and cytokinesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;Attention has been paid to recruiting a diverse group of speakers, including both senior and early-career investigators. Support will be provided as scholarships to students and postdoctoral fellows chosen based on need; scholarships will be limited to one per research lab, to ensure broad use of the funds. Priority will be given to underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
