    <AbstractNarration>Through efforts of TCUP I and II, the foundation is now in place at Chief Dull Knife&lt;br/&gt;College for taking the next steps in conducting more sophisticated and nuanced research that will&lt;br/&gt;assess the impact of the expanded and improved learning opportunities offered to CDKC&lt;br/&gt;students in math and science. This research proposal responds to the call by Trowler (2005) for&lt;br/&gt;improved research on higher education reforms that reveal how specific innovations relate to&lt;br/&gt;particular teaching and learning contexts. The development of data sources and instruments for&lt;br/&gt;documenting student progress and for TCUP project assessments has created a unique&lt;br/&gt;opportunity now to conduct research that has not been possible before. The research capability&lt;br/&gt;development will include the creation of a database that incorporates and coordinates all the&lt;br/&gt;existing data sources and the establishment of procedures for accessing relevant data to address&lt;br/&gt;research questions about STEM programs and their impacts on students. Database development&lt;br/&gt;will draw on multiple data sources and will allow a wide range of questions to be addressed with a&lt;br/&gt;variety of statistical techniques. The approach used for developing and addressing research&lt;br/&gt;questions will incorporate the central principles of the Indigenous Evaluation framework, an&lt;br/&gt;approach to research on and evaluation of American Indian education and other programs&lt;br/&gt;developed by the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) with support from the&lt;br/&gt;National Science Foundation (LaFrance and Nichols 2010). For this project, the research&lt;br/&gt;approach makes central the values and interests of groups most concerned with the academic&lt;br/&gt;achievement of CDKC students and relationship to the Northern Cheyenne community. It also&lt;br/&gt;builds on prior sociological research on Northern Cheyenne secondary school completion (Ward&lt;br/&gt;2005) that identified individual, family, school and community as particularly relevant influences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research program represents important questions related to American Indian tribal college&lt;br/&gt;student retention and completion in relation to STEM that moves well beyond any analyses to&lt;br/&gt;date on Northern Cheyenne college students. It also fills gaps in understandings about the&lt;br/&gt;processes that contribute to student outcomes in a tribal college setting that is both unique and&lt;br/&gt;relevant to other higher education settings. It will create the basis for addressing how&lt;br/&gt;relationships with local and regional institutions and the research opportunities they offer impact&lt;br/&gt;students and faculty. Additionally, the capabilities resulting from this project provide for sharing&lt;br/&gt;and disseminating research results to educators at other tribal colleges and higher education&lt;br/&gt;institutions who have similar concerns about and interests in creating more effective STEM&lt;br/&gt;learning opportunities for American Indian and other minority students.</AbstractNarration>
