    <AbstractNarration>The Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS) will have its first&lt;br/&gt;conference of Academic Year 2013-2014 at Rutgers University in either&lt;br/&gt;September or October 2013.&lt;br/&gt;MAMLS was formed in the fall of 1982 under the aegis of Lee Stanley and&lt;br/&gt;has supported 2-4 regional meetings per year of 1-2 days' duration&lt;br/&gt;since then. These meetings are held at various locations and cover a broad&lt;br/&gt;spectrum of mathematical logic, with particular emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;complexity theory, theoretical computer science, fragments of&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic, pure and applied model theory, proof theory,&lt;br/&gt;recursion theory/computability theory, set theory, subsystems of&lt;br/&gt;analysis in accordance with the program of H. Friedman and S. Simpson,&lt;br/&gt;and topos theory. NSF support is provided for some of the expenses&lt;br/&gt;of the speakers and attendees, in particular of the graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and those without access to their own funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Via the meetings sponsored, the MAMLS grant maintains the&lt;br/&gt;vitality of the field of mathematical logic. Special emphasis is&lt;br/&gt;placed on enhancing the participation of younger researchers and&lt;br/&gt;members of traditionally underrepresented groups, especially&lt;br/&gt;women. This is done by providing an intellectual forum in which&lt;br/&gt;all interested persons are invited to contribute and in which&lt;br/&gt;there are lectures on current topics of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information about MAMLS may be found by visiting http://mamls.org</AbstractNarration>
