    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the development of the friction extrusion process and associated equipment to enable direct production of high-value materials (such as titanium wires) from low-cost precursors (such as powders or machining chips) with reduced energy consumption. Friction extrusion die and process chamber design will be studied. Experiments and numerical simulations will be carried out to develop an in-depth understanding of the scientific principles and physical mechanisms operating in the friction extrusion process. Friction extrusion experiments will be carried out to gain a physical understanding of the process and equipment, such as the effect of extrusion die and chamber design on power consumption and quality of the produced wire. Computational models will be created to simulate the extrusion process in order to investigate issues (e.g. full-field material flow pattern and thermal history) not approachable experimentally. Validation and visualization experiments will be designed and performed to provide measurements of material position, velocity and temperature for validating simulation model predictions, so that computational models can be utilized reliably for process design and optimization purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research can be used to enable the design, optimization and utilization of the friction extrusion process for the energy-efficient production of high-value materials from low-cost precursors and for recycling machining wastes (chips). The friction extrusion process has the potential to greatly reduce energy requirements for the production of titanium wire feedstock by eliminating costly vacuum melting and billet casting. Wires produced from this process could be used as feedstock for additive manufacturing processes or as filler wires for niche welding applications.</AbstractNarration>
