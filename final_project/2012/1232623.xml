    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for theoretical and software development of novel algorithms for processing large-scale optimization models arising in Signal Processing,&lt;br/&gt;Medical Image Reconstruction, Machine Learning, and high-dimensional Statistical inference, where huge and steadily growing amounts of underlying data result in the&lt;br/&gt;necessity to process optimization problems with hundreds of thousands of variables and constraints. In addition, some of applications, such as low rank matrix&lt;br/&gt;approximations, lead to problems with difficult geometry, which amplifies significantly the challenges caused by sheer problem sizes. These challenges will be&lt;br/&gt;met via developing algorithms with cheap iterations utilizing state-of-the-art approaches, primarily bilinear saddle point reformulation of the problem of interest&lt;br/&gt;combined with duality-based handling difficult geometry and accelerating algorithms via various types of randomization. Theoretical and algorithmic developments&lt;br/&gt;will be adjusted to several generic applications (sparsity- and low-rank oriented Signal Processing and Machine Learning, extensions of total variation-based Image&lt;br/&gt;processing, and some others) and will be aimed at developing optimization techniques with good theoretical performance guarantees and visible practical potential;&lt;br/&gt;the latter will be validated by extensive numerical experimentation with both simulated and real life problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research will advance theory and practice of optimization by enriching its abilities to process large-scale/complex geometry problems and thus will&lt;br/&gt;contribute significantly to the computational toolboxes in Signal Processing, Image Reconstruction, Machine Learning, and some other subject domains. As a byproduct,&lt;br/&gt;the research will contribute to recent tendency of bridging the corresponding research communities, with clear mutual benefits. In addition, the results of&lt;br/&gt;the research could form the base of new Ph.D.-level optimization courses.</AbstractNarration>
