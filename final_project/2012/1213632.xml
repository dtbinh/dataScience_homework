    <AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports the research of Professors Giuseppe Petrucci from the University of Vermont and Scot T. Martin from Harvard University who will elucidate the relationships between molecular composition and phase of biogenic secondary aerosols (BSOA) and the subsequent impact on BSOA optical properties and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity. This research will build an unprecedented understanding of the link between molecular-level aerosol properties and the role of BSOA in regulating Earth's radiative balance. The synergism made possible by bringing together established expertise and research infrastructure within each institution would ensure rapid advance of the understanding of this critical aspect of atmospheric organic aerosol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The improved understanding of the complex interdependent relationships between chemical, phase and optical properties of organic aerosols, as well as the fundamental data that will be obtained will be of great benefit to the atmospheric sciences community at large. Furthermore, the collaborative research and training infrastructure as well as training opportunities, will be enhanced significantly and provide a critical foundation for future advances in this area.</AbstractNarration>
