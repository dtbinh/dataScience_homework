    <AbstractNarration>This grant will provide the partial support of two symposia to be held at the TMS 2013 Annual Meeting and Exhibition, held 3-7 March 2013, at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio, Texas. The attendees will include representatives from industry, academia, and government from more than 68 countries. Two symposia will be supported. The Frontiers in Solidification Symposium will include six sessions focused on papers relating to emerging developments in solidification science and engineering. The Bulk Metallic Glasses X Symposium will consist of ten sessions focused on papers relating to fundamental understanding and theoretical modeling of the processing and mechanical behavior of bulk metallic glasses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Registration and travel support will enable six graduate students and six post-docs to attend the conference and symposia. Findings and presentations from the conference will be published as conference proceedings and will be available to all attendees.</AbstractNarration>
