    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for US students and lecturers to attend the Seventh International Accelerator School for Linear Colliders to be held at the Raja Ramanna Center for Advanced Technology (RRCAT) in Indore, India, 27 November through 8 December 2012. The program of the school will cover a wide range of topics related to lepton colliders, from beam dynamics to damping rings, from superconducting radio frequency technologies to precise instrumentation, from room temperature radio frequency technology to beam delivery systems . The school will serve as an opportunity for US students and post docs to interact with their counterparts from other regions of the world and to form collaborations and partnerships. The program is supported jointly by NSF Division of Physics, through its program in Experimental Elementary Particle Physics, and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering, through its Global Venture Fund.</AbstractNarration>
