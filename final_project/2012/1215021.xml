    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on the development of a novel ultrasonic acoustophoretic separation technology that is economic, efficient, sustainable, and environmentally benign. Current technologies, e.g., hydrocyclones, and membrane filtration, suffer from problems, such as high cost of energy, use of consumables, fouling, and limited efficiency in separation of micron-sized particles. The proposed large volume flow rate acoustophoretic separation technology does not generate waste, does not use consumables, operates at a low cost of energy, and provides efficient separation for micron-size particles. Ultrasonic standing waves are used to trap secondary phase particles in a fluid stream, when the acoustic radiation force exerted on the particles is stronger than the combined effect of fluid drag force and buoyancy. The action of the acoustic forces on the trapped particles results in concentration, agglomeration and/or coalescence of particles and droplets. Heavier than water particles are separated through enhanced gravitational settling, and lighter particles through enhanced buoyancy. This project combines experiment and computer modeling to probe the interaction between piezo-electric transducers and the acoustic field to maximize the acoustic trapping potential and to provide results to create scalable systems and economic models of capital and operational expense of the technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the novel acoustophoretic separation technology provides for a cheaper and lower cost of energy separation of multi-component phase mixtures. It can function as a drop-in replacement for conventional separation technology, such as hydrocyclones and other methods. The societal impact is the development of separation technologies that are sustainable and environmentally benign since they do not generate any waste or use consumables. Enhanced extraction of micron-sized oil droplets from water offer opportunities for enhanced oil recovery and oil-spill cleanup and reduce the emission of micron-sized oil droplets into the environment. This project increases the science and technology of acoustic radiation force in ultrasonic standing waves. A full three-dimensional accounting of the acoustic radiation force in realistic geometries will be done. Dissemination of this work will be done by publishing our results in peer reviewed journals and conferences. This project provides several internships to undergraduate engineering students, an opportunity to learn and practice engineering, innovation, and entrepreneurship at a small start-up company. FD Sonics has a strong history and commitment to integrating undergraduate students in the development of their technology through offering internships and providing supervision for senior capstone design projects.</AbstractNarration>
