    <AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Roger Revelle, a 273? general purpose Global vessel; the R/V Melville, a 279?general purpose Global vessel; the R/V New Horizon, a 170?, general purpose, Ocean/Intermediate vessel and the R/V Sproul, a 125? general purpose Coastal/Local vessel. All four vessels are operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both R/V Roger Revelle and R/V Melville are Global vessels and support multidisciplinary oceanographic research in all of the world?s ocean basins. R/V New Horizon focuses primarily on offshore California but has been used for work throughout the Pacific. The primary working area for R/V Sproul has been the continental shelf and coastal environments off Southern California. In 2012, R/V Roger Revelle is scheduled for 281 days with NSF days accounting for 64% of the total sailing schedule; R/V Melville is scheduled for 281 days with NSF days accounting for 60% of the total sailing schedule; R/V New Horizon is scheduled for 131 days with NSF days accounting for 60% of the total sailing schedule; and R/V Sproul is scheduled for 91 days with NSF days accounting for 35% of the total sailing schedule&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Disk Storage Servers $36,215&lt;br/&gt;2) TrackLink 5000 USBL $64,564&lt;br/&gt;3) Air Winches $111,285&lt;br/&gt;4) EIVA Geophysical Software $50,222&lt;br/&gt;5) SeaSoar Block $16,897&lt;br/&gt;6) SeaSoar Hydraulic Unit $59,574&lt;br/&gt;7) 10m2 MOCNESS Components $46,217&lt;br/&gt; TOTAL $384,974&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>
