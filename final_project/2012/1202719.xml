    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical models for reinforcement of assortative mating&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical models are used to gain insight into complex evolutionary processes and to quantify evolutionary forces. This study proposes two projects that use mathematical models in both of these ways to investigate the role of natural selection in speciation. Specifically, this work investigates the process of reinforcement in which selection favors the evolution of reproductive isolation that decreases costly hybridization. The first proposed project would create analytic models to determine the conditions under which selection against hybrids can cause reinforcement of assortative mating. The second proposed project will combine mathematical models with empirical observations to estimate the strength of selection, the rate of hybridization, and migration affecting reinforcement in the Texas wildflower, Phlox drummondii. A spatially-explicit simulation model will be developed based on the geography and genetics of natural P. drummondii populations. This model will be fit to empirical data to give the first estimates of evolutionary parameters involved in reinforcement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed projects will train the postdoctoral fellow in diverse mathematical, simulation, and statistical methods such as learning to create and solve dynamic systems, methods of approximation, and likelihood methods. This fellowship work includes creating a Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) club at a local Austin middle school, which serves a diverse student body. The major goal of the STEM club will be to guide students through the design and execution of their own research projects.</AbstractNarration>
