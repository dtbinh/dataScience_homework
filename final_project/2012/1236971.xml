    <AbstractNarration>This project will document and evaluate a range of ongoing efforts to revitalize Itelmen - an endangered indigenous language spoken in northwest Kamchatka. The proposed research will be to critique the effectiveness of language revitalization tools and programs in the Itelmen context. It is anticipated that this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of language and cultural revitalization programs not only among the Itelmen of Kamchatka but has great potential to inform about these programs world wide. In addition, the student researcher's, Tatiana Degai's, scholarship can contribute much to the development of de-colonized methodologies, a growing field of study among many indigenous scholars and other social scientists. In addition, the broader impacts of the proposed project are compelling. The preservation of this language in the face of centuries of assimilation programs enacted by Russian Imperial and later Soviet administrations is significant. The most significant broader impact is what other Indigenous communities in a similar situation to the Itelman can learn from this community's struggles and efforts. In addition, as an indigenous scholar Degai stands to empower her own study/heritage community and to inspire other indigenous scholars.</AbstractNarration>
