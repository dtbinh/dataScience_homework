    <AbstractNarration>Nitrogen (N) is an essential macronutrient whose availability can limit primary production and the capacity of the biological pump to export carbon from the surface ocean on seasonal, annual, decadal, and millennial timescales. The inventory of fixed (bioavailable) N in the ocean is driven by biological processes such as nitrogen fixation, denitrification, and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox). Water column oxygen deficient zones (ODZs) are important sites for fixed N loss, as well as N2O production, and they are projected to expand and intensify in the coming years as global warming increases ocean stratification and decreases ventilation. It is important to understand the distribution of nitrate, nitrite, and N2O isotopes in relation to current ocean conditions of oxygen and trace element availability order to interpret past and future changes in nitrate Ã¤15N signals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a team of researchers from Stanford University, University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, and Brown University will measure the nitrogen- and oxygen-isotopic composition (del15N and del18O) of nitrate, nitrite, and nitrous oxide in seawater samples collected along the GEOTRACES Pacific Peru-Tahiti Section. Values of del15N and del18O will also be measured in nitrate from aerosol and rain samples to inform our interpretation of the N isotope budget and isotopic gradients within the tropical South Pacific. Finally, N2/Ar and N2 del15N will be determined to close the N mass and isotope budgets. Nitrate del15N is a GEOTRACES "core parameter" that will complement other measurements, such as bioactive trace element concentrations and speciation, Si isotope variations, as well as redox and productivity proxies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GEOTRACES Peru-Tahiti section provides a rare opportunity to track the fate of the isotopic signals of N loss from one of the largest water column ODZs. Furthermore, little is known about the effect of N recycling through hydrothermal vents on nitrate isotopes in the deep ocean, and this section will allow quantitative tracking of this input. Together, these measurements will yield insight into the relative rates of modern N cycle processes and will provide background information for paleoceanographic applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This project will provide a high-quality nitrate isotope data set from undersampled parts of the South Pacific for use by the broader oceanographic community via BCO-DMO. Educational impacts include the mentoring of a graduate, undergraduate, and high school students at Stanford, and the inclusion of undergraduates in state-of-the-art collaborative research at Brown and UMass-Dartmouth. The project will also support development and implementation of an oceans component for the annual 6th grade teacher workshop offered by Stanford University's School of Earth. This program includes both instruction for the teachers on cutting-edge research in Earth Science and Oceanography, and support for them to include the material into their classroom activities.</AbstractNarration>
