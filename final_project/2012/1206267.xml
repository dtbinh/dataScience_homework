    <AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The present proposal is focusing on implementing techniques closely related to quantum optics in solid-state systems containing diluted, highly coherent spins. The control of dynamics of spins in solid-state materials has direct implications at both fundamental and applied levels. Research topics, in particular quantum computing, rely heavily on both complex control techniques and long spin coherence times to achieve intricate and robust information control. One aspect of this proposal is to identify new supramolecular structures with long spin coherence times. A natural way of driving spin orientation is by using electromagnetic fields (photons) and it can be done either as a classical rotation or by entanglement with the field itself. The studies are to be performed at very low temperatures, using on-chip, superconducting devices (planar cavities and micro-squids). The present program will train undergraduate and graduate students, sustain PI's involvement in the Research Experience for Undergraduates and Teachers programs, and in the development of scientific demonstrations at outreach events in the FSU and NHMFL campuses&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Modern technological applications are aiming closer and closer to a limit where quantum mechanics is the main theoretical tool. Often, electronic chips and small components are involved in such applications. At the same time, an impressive amount of research has been done in the case of atoms in dilute gases, since such systems are governed purely by Quantum Mechanics. Here, we propose to implement techniques of quantum optics into the field of solid-state physics, to develop new experimental tools. Also, we will search for new supramolecular materials capable of sustaining for long times quantum information, for on-chip applications like Quantum Computing. The studies are to be performed at very low temperatures, using on-chip, superconducting devices (planar cavities and micro-squids). This research is intrinsically connected to the act of teaching: if we teach our students well, we will have top scientists in the future. The present program will train undergraduate and graduate students, sustain PI's involvement in the Research Experience for Undergraduates and Teachers programs, and in the development of scientific demonstrations at outreach events in the FSU and NHMFL campuses. Moreover, through association with the NHMFL, a broad condensed matter community (users, visitors, and students) will interact closely with the proposed research.</AbstractNarration>
