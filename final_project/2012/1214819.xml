    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the development of a novel low-profile miniature wireless pressure sensing system, customized for industrial and medical applications where a small-sized, low cost, low-profile (flat) sensor is required. These miniature wireless sensors will contain all system components (sensor, electronics, inductor coil) in one small system. The fabrication process for this wireless sensor is also designed to be simpler and easier to manufacture than existing sensors. The most important medical application being targeted for the proposed sensors is for neurological pressure monitoring, namely intracranial pressure sensors for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) as well as shunt pressure monitors for patients with hydrocephalus. This technology will provide safe, chronic, fast, detailed, real time, continuous, comprehensive, intracranial pressure measurements, and supports the trend towards home health monitoring, with the potential to revolutionize the way patients are treated. The advantages of the proposed miniature wireless systems are: (a) low profile (flat) - ideal for minimally invasive placement in neurological pressure monitoring applications, (b) miniature wireless system which integrates all system components in one small package, (c) low cost, robust, and manufacturable, (d) easily customized for a variety of pressure monitoring applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential commercial value of this Small Business Innovation Research proposal will be in several areas. The final goal is the commercialization of the proposed wireless pressure monitoring systems for use in industrial and medical applications. Commercial applications include any area that is in need of wireless pressure sensing; for example, aerospace, automotive and industrial applications. The larger market for the proposed sensors is for medical applications. The medical markets are neurological pressure monitoring products, namely intracranial pressure sensors for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) as well as shunt pressure monitors for patients with hydrocephalus. Approximately 1.4 million people are treated for head injuries, with over a quarter million being moderate or severe injuries. TBI accounts for approximately 70,000 deaths each year in America, with an additional 80,000 patients having severe long-term disabilities. Hydrocephalus is among the most common birth defects, affecting 1 in 1000 babies, as well as many adults. Approximately 70,000 patients are discharged from hospitals with the diagnosis of hydrocephalus each year. Nearly 36,000 shunt-related procedures a year translates to $100's million dollars worth of medical expense.</AbstractNarration>
