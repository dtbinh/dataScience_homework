    <AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) will study the combined effects of self-generated wave dynamics and local Coulomb collisional dynamics on electrons in the solar wind, while focusing on local acceleration of electrons to suprathermal velocities by self-generated enhanced electrostatic fluctuations. The PI's objective is to determine the physical origin of the so-called 'kappa' velocity distribution function (VDF) associated with the solar wind electrons. Since this task has not been attempted before, the PI expects these results to shed light on electron dynamics in the solar wind, and to help experimenters in interpreting their existing data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI notes that the turbulent and nonlinear plasma processes to be studied here affect charged particle acceleration in many different laboratory and astrophysical environments, and that this effort will therefore have wider interdisciplinary impact. The PI's numerical results will be shared with the community through workshops and publications. This project will also contribute to the education and training of a young postdoctoral scientist.</AbstractNarration>
