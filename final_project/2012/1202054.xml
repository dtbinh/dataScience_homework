    <AbstractNarration>Objective: The transistor considered in this proposal is known as the Tunneling Field Effect Transistor (TFET). To be competitive with the conventional transistors, the TFET needs a drive current above 100 ?ÝA/?n?Ým and a subthreshold slope below 60 mV/dec at 0.5 V. Such a transistor has yet to be realized and is the ultimate goal of this proposal. The approach in this proposal is spread through three objectives: diode characterization, transistor design/demonstration, and circuit architecture. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: TFETs are among the leading candidates for next generation transistor technology beyond CMOS. The proposed activities will provide a substantial experimental database that will transform the understanding/demonstration of TFETs through its analysis of (i) optimal material composition (2-terminal diode screening), (ii) lateral TFETs (proximity diffused or alloyed junction source), (iii) vertical TFETs (metal-first or mesa-first source), (iv) TFET SPICE model extraction, and (v) novel circuit design. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The results of the project will be disseminated through a multi-tiered web site for public and private access. The work will be carried out by domestic graduate students who will be exposed to industrial and global interactions through external partners such as SEMATECH, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. The PI also presents an integrated and realistic K-12 outreach plan in conjunction with West Irondequoit High School in suburban Rochester, NY. The PI will also develop unique exhibits for RIT¡¦s yearly Imagine RIT festival, a forum for public exposure to science.</AbstractNarration>
