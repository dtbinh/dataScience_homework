    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Nicholas Day of Portland State University to conduct a research project, entitled "A light-absorbing catalyst to stimulate the conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol," during the summer of 2012 at Osaka University in Suita, Osaka. The host scientist is Dr. Shunichi Fukuzumi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is advancing the knowledge of potential renewable energy sources. The direct focus of this research is to investigate a novel material with the potential ability to use renewable resources to produce liquid fuel which can be utilized with current infrastructure. In particular a cobalt metallated poly-tetrakis-5,10,15,20-(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin is being used to reduce carbon dioxide to methanol using only sunlight. Methanol is seen as a viable source of energy for the near future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Also planned is a solar cell demonstration to students at Takarazuka-Kita high school. Providing education of renewable energy sources to students in Japan is highly relevant considering the high demand for new energy sources in Japan and the U.S.</AbstractNarration>
