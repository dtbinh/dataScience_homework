    <AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of remote, broadband THz wave sensing technology is lagging behind the compelling needs that exist in the areas of astronomy, global environmental monitoring, and homeland security. This is due to the challenge posed by high absorption by ambient moisture in the THz range. The objective of this proposal is to investigate THz air-plasma technology to meet this great challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ambient air, when excited with intense femtosecond laser beams, exhibits a remarkable ability to generate and detect pulsed THz waves through an optical nonlinear process. The use of air-plasma as a broadband THz wave emitter and THz wave sensor provides superior frequency bandwidth (0.1 - 40 THz), peak field strength (&gt; 1MV/cm), sensitivity (heterodyne), and resolution (&lt; MHz). We propose to measure the ?rectified? THz field inside of the plasma filament with two-color laser beams by using the optical Stark effect to explore the limitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The greatest demand for THz imaging is in the form of a nondestructive evaluation system. Suppliers within the fields of defense and homeland security are seeking ways to better sense chemical and biological weapons and explosives. Our proposed development of the THz air-plasma project will provide key technology that will enable interdisciplinary research and advance numerous THz wave sensing and imaging developments. As interdisciplinary research, this renewal project will continue to provide excellent collaborative opportunities to promote teaching, training, and learning among students with diverse ethnic backgrounds and within underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
