    <AbstractNarration>The University of Notre Dame will host the Conference on Metric Geometry and Applications during March 14-17, 2013. The objective of the conference is to provide a forum for the presentation, exchange and discussion of new ideas and directions in the broad area of metric geometry and its interface with other areas. Another goal of the conference is to provide an informal setting for graduate students and younger researchers in the USA to learn of the newest trends and interact with prominent geometers and geometric analysts. The topics treated at the conference are at the core of metric geometry and its impact on other areas such as comparison geometry, Alexandrov geometry, and geometric analysis with emphasis on geometric flows and complex geometry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The abstract notion of distance has always played an important role in mathematics and applications. During the last few decades geometry and analysis in this general setting has witnessed dramatic developments and in turn is playing an increasingly important role in many areas of mathematics. The topics to be treated at the conference represent vibrant and growing fields with strong interactions to large classical areas in geometry and analysis. The strong field of speakers include several of the best contemporary researchers in these areas, and their work has opened up new and important avenues of investigation. Besides providing and opportunity for senior researchers to exchange ideas and discuss important new results and directions, another equally important goal of the conference is to foster interaction among graduate students from different universities. Graduate students and junior researchers have much to gain from being exposed to the most recent research problems and from contact with students and faculty from universities other than their own. Participation at such an event could trigger interesting thesis projects, or suggest new ideas for ongoing research.
