    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. This award supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site led by Professors Osvaldo Cox and Beatriz Zayas both at Universidad Metropolitana in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The REU Site is located at four campuses of the University of Puerto Rico and the Arecibo Observatory. The research projects supported at these Sites entitled, "Research Training in Cross-disciplinary Chemical Sciences" will engage disadvantaged Hispanic STEM students and will to bring together five institutions and a multidisciplinary mentoring team to increase the research competitiveness of these chemistry students and improve their numbers in the STEM pipeline in the chemical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site anticipates an increase in chemistry majors who will experience research competitiveness, gain confidence, and develop an interest in graduate schools, as well as become professionals who are prepared to enter the STEM workforce. This REU will also benefit the entire community of chemistry students at UMET who can also participate in the REU developmental activities during the academic year. It brings together five institutions and a mentoring team who will increase the research competitiveness of these students and positively impact the STEM pipeline in the chemical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
