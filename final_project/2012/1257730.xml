    <AbstractNarration>The development of a cell occurs in a complicated context of multiple interacting factors from the molecular and subcellular levels to the external environment of the cell. In addition to their well-established role in neuronal communication, classical neurotransmitters are also involved in aspects of the development of neuronal cells (neurons). Experiments in this project address how the development and neuronal geometry of complex amine neurons depend on the localization and distribution of the neurotransmitter octopamine, in combination with surrounding extracellular matrix components and how these altered neurons affect aggressive behavior. This project utilizes cutting-edge genetic tools with classical mutational analysis available in the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to determine how the morphology of neurons is affected by altered octopamine levels and extracellular matrix components. The outcomes of these experiments will significantly contribute to understanding how the individual microenvironment modulates the development, circuit connectivity and function of neuronal cells that form during embryogenesis and affect the behavior of an animal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will increase the exposure of Montana K-6 students' to science and scientific research through the creation of an engaging science podcast designed for second-sixth grade classrooms which will be shared with public schools across the state. The podcast integrates this research on Drosophila neuronal development and aggression into a visually stimulating presentation to promote learning and spark students' interest in science. In addition to the podcast, live specimens of different Drosophila life cycle and developmental stages will be sent to the classrooms, as the inclusion of living examples provides a significant hands-on learning component solidifying the video information into a fun and memorable experience. In addition to receiving research training and mentoring, graduate students involved in this research will participate in local elementary school presentations to demonstrate aspects of their research. These interactions provide a meaningful experience to build the student?s own scientific presentation skills and engage the public at an elementary school level.</AbstractNarration>
