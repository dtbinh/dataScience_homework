    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The hallmark of systems biology is often presented as the pursuit of understanding how biological systems function. Once such understanding is gained, it can be utilized to the manipulation and optimization of existing systems toward worthwhile goals or toward the creation of entirely new systems within the nascent field of synthetic biology. Interestingly, the meaning of "understanding biological systems" varies quite widely among the practitioners of systems biology. For some, it is the confirmation that mathematical representations of components and processes, when merged into a larger model, fit together and collectively yield responses similar to those observed in actuality. If so, one assumes that further predictions with the model are reasonably reliable as well. In interesting cases, the merging of processes has the potential of leading to new, emerging properties. Others define as the desirable goal a collection of very accurate simulation systems, including complete cell simulators. Like a flight simulator that is used for pilot training, a biological systems simulator could mimic simple, frequently encountered situations, as well as very rare and complex emergencies or outliers, and thereby hone skill and intuition of students and researchers alike. Yet others define "understanding" as the discovery and elucidation of general organizing principles in the form of network motifs or design and operating principles. This interpretation of understanding aims to explain and rationalize why nature uses certain structures and strategies to solve specific tasks, but not alternatives that seem equally reasonable. As one easily imagines, the different goals have been addressed with genuinely different computational methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on the interplay between these apparently disparate goals, which clearly address different aspects of the same phenomena. It will facilitate discussions of the different variants, their purposes, and methods, and help the field characterize the role of one in the pursuit of the others. The conference will also encourage presentations on the education of biologists, computational scientists and engineers in the emerging fields of systems and synthetic biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The conference will be kept relatively small, with an expected enrollment of about 100 participants. This size will be particularly appealing to students and junior faculty, who will have the opportunity to meet leaders in the field face to face. Senior researchers will be invited to present introductory talks, but every effort will be made to assure that junior colleagues and students have a stake in the design of the program and the execution of the conference. To this end, the organizing committee will consist of two senior and three junior faculty, including two members from underserved groups, as well as two students. Students and postdoctoral fellows will be encouraged to participate and present talks and posters and be given, on a competitive basis, conference fee waivers and travel stipends, as far as the budget allows.</AbstractNarration>
