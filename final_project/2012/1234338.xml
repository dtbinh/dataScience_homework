    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to test the hypothesis that the electromagnetic field associated with the nuclear radiation incident on semiconductor channels will interact with the spin of the electrons via the Rashba spin-orbit interaction mechanism. The approach will be to design 4-terminal non-local spin-valve devices comprised of wide band-gap semiconductor channels over which four electrodes will be deposited. Inner two electrodes will be made out of a ferromagnetic metal while the outer two electrodes will be made out of a nonmagnetic metal. Geometry of the magnetic electrodes will be kept different deliberately in order to make their coercivities dissimilar so that their relative orientation (parallel or antiparallel) could be changed independently. These spin-valve sensors will be exposed to controlled radiation environments and non-local measurements of magneto-resistance and Hanle-effect will be performed. Experimental research will be supported by Monte Carlo simulation and theoretical modeling to understand the mechanism of radiation-spin interaction in semiconductors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will lead to room-temperature nuclear radiation detectors which will find applications in various civil, mechanical, manufacturing, medical imaging and security systems. The research outcomes will greatly reduce nuclear and radiological threats and benefit the society at large. The project will promote learning and education by involving K-12, undergraduate and graduate students in the inherently interdisciplinary cooperative research activities. The discoveries of this project will be presented at related technical conferences by the principal investigators and graduate students. Research results will be published in high impact peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>
