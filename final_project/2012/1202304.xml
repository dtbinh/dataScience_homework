    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop a biocompatible, fabricated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent platform with novel properties, including sensory capability, and potential for wide application to biomedical research. The approach is to employ both top-down and self assembly approaches, incorporating environmentally responsive materials, to develop a class of contrast agents which address major limitations of currently available agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the development of next generation MRI contrast agents using micro- and nanofabrication techniques incorporating biocompatible magnetic materials to develop a series of geometrically precise, particulate contrast agents yielding distinct spectral signatures with multiplexing capability. In addition, the incorporation of biocompatible hydrogels, tunable to respond to myriad environmental stimuli, into the fabrication process will yield in vivo biological sensing capability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed MRI contrast agents includes an expanded role of MRI in biomedical applications from the bench to the bedside. Multiplexed imaging, paired with an in vivo sensing capability, would dramatically potentiate the study of myriad diseases using MRI. In addition to the research impact, this project offers a rich potential for educating pre-college, undergraduate and graduate students given its multidisciplinary nature, integrating materials science, micro- and nanofabrication techniques, as well as imaging science and a focus on biomedical application. Finally, the investigators will take part in Boston University's Summer High School Honors Program to mentor high school students on this project, a unique opportunity to expose the top students from across the country to a rich, interdisciplinary educational experience.</AbstractNarration>
