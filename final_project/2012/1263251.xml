    <AbstractNarration>The Biosphere 2 Research Education for Undergraduates site: the Environmental and Earth Systems Research at Biosphere 2 (B2- EESR REU) program leverages the unique nature of the University of Arizona Biosphere 2 (B2). B2 serves as a laboratory for controlled scientific studies that monitor global environmental change and that allow integration across spatial and temporal scales. The goals for students in this summer REU program are to: (1) develop research skills; (2) experience the cross-disciplinary collaborations that characterize work in Earth system science; (3) develop an understanding of practical aspects of pursuing a career in science, including the nature of graduate school., and (4) receive training and experience communicating research to the public. Research projects conducted through this program contribute to an interdisciplinary understanding of the Earth system with particular focus on the critical zone, how ecosystems respond to environmental variation and anthropogenic change, and how physical and biological elements of systems are integrated. Projects draw from several disciplines, including, ecology, biology, geosciences, hydrology, soil science, climate and atmospheric sciences. Students work with a faculty mentor on an individual field or laboratory project, participate in weekly training sessions on career skills, and present their research to the public and scientific peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site investigates the responses of the Earth's ecosystems to variation and human-induced changes by linking physical and biological processes and linking model and real-world systems. Through active research, students learn first-hand how model and real world systems are used to generate scientific understanding. The program trains the next generation of scientists to tackle environmental issues with necessary skills that bridge disciplines and with the ability to communicate research findings to the public and policy makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
