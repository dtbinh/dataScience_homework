    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes an interdisciplinary, two-day workshop to be held in Indianapolis, Indiana in June 2012. The goal of this workshop is to facilitate discussion of research opportunities available from logistics hubs in the Transantarctic Mountains and reach a consensus on the site with the highest scientific priority. This prioritization will be based on which field site will provide a platform from which the most compelling mix of bio-, cryo-, geo-, and atmospheric science questions can be addressed to advance knowledge of the Transantarctic Mountains. This workshop will also develop a long-range plan to capitalize on research opportunities at other sites. A small group of scientists from the New Zealand Antarctic program will be invited to attend the workshop to maintain this historically strong partnership. The PI emphasizes that another objective of the TAM Camp workshop is to promote participation by new Antarctic PIs. To support this objective, they will have a special session on the third day of the workshop dedicated to logistics planning. In advance of the workshop, information about each potential site will be made available on a Google-based interactive website. The site will contain places for experienced PIs to post information on each proposed site from their past experiences and places for new investigators to post questions. This approach should provide bridges between scientists of differing levels of experience and possibly promote new collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing training in the area of field planning for new investigators, this proposal would provide teaching and training opportunities for several undergraduate and graduate students at IUPUI who will help with website design and content development as well as workshop implementation.</AbstractNarration>
