    <AbstractNarration>The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is the biggest annual conference of the information theory society. It has been held continuously since 1954. It covers almost all the topics related to the studies on information theory, including coding, compression, statistics, complexity, inference, cryptography, as well as many innovative directions such as networking, quantum computing, and other emerging applications of information theory. It is considered the highest standard of IEEE conferences. It has been supported by US Funding Agencies, especially NSF, to facilitate the participation by students and young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year, ISIT will be held at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The location is chosen not only because it is one of the birth places of information theory, but also an on-campus conference is aimed at reducing the travel costs of attendees. We expect the size of the conference to be larger than in recent years, and thus travel support is more crucial for this conference. ISIT has a well established method of allocating the requested travel funds by selecting&lt;br/&gt;the most meritorious and needy students to present their papers at the symposium. This year, the travel support is combined with other forms of local arrangement including the use of MIT dorm rooms, organized child care, etc., to encourage more student attendance.</AbstractNarration>
