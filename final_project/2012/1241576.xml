    <AbstractNarration>To meet America's cybersecurity needs, the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) is developing educated professionals in this interdisciplinary field by offering scholarships for students to study cybersecurity and Information Assurance at UMBC under the CyberCorpsÂ®: Scholarship for Service (SFS) Program. Scholars pursue BA or BS, MS, combined BS/MS, MPS, or PhD degrees through existing programs in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and the Masters in Professional Studies: Cybersecurity in the Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. Qualified students from related fields also are welcome, including Electrical Engineering, Information Systems, Mathematics, Physics, Education, and Public Policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students at the UMBC Center for Information Security and Assurance engage in mentored research projects at partner organizations, including Northrop Grumman, JHU Applied Physics Lab, Convergent Technologies, DoD Cyber Crime Institute, Parabal, and the UMBC Office of Information Technology. Research opportunities exist at many UMBC labs, including at the UMBC Cyber Defense Lab, where current projects include digital cloud forensics, forensics visualization, high-security voting systems, and delay- and disruption-tolerant networks for a solar system Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is increasing the number of qualified professionals in cybersecurity, which strengthens American security and competitiveness. To enhance quality in cybersecurity education, in years 2-4 of the project, UMBC is hosting a one-day regional public workshop focusing on innovations for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate cybersecurity education. To attract and retain minorities and other underrepresented students, UMBC's SFS effort cooperates closely with UMBC's nationally recognized Meyerhoff Program, Center for Women in Technology, and other university organizations.</AbstractNarration>
