    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Clint Duncan Frye of Kansas State University to conduct a research project, entitled "Developing materials to convert directly heat into electricity," during the summer of 2012 at the National Institute for Materials Science in Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. The host scientist is Takao Mori.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the investigation of the thermoelectric properties of various boron compounds. Materials prepared at Kansas State University will be characterized at the National Institute of Materials Science to assess their potential to convert heat into electricity and produce cutting-edge knowledge about the synthesis of new compounds and crystals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
