    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to demonstrate novel silicon-integratible graphene-based&lt;br/&gt;devices, including the metal-oxide-graphene-silicon field-effect transistor to achieve drain&lt;br/&gt;current saturation with a zero bandgap, and the graphene-insulator-graphene junction to achieve&lt;br/&gt;resonance tunneling. These devices are expected to harness the enormous momentum behind&lt;br/&gt;silicon manufacturing, exploit the unique advantages graphene while circumventing serious&lt;br/&gt;challenges, thus find niche applications for technology entry, and eventually enter the&lt;br/&gt;mainstream digital arena with full potential enabled by future progress.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This project represents coherent research efforts spanning materials, concepts,&lt;br/&gt;and implementation. The materials growth research will seek answers to fundamental questions&lt;br/&gt;about heteroepitaxy of two-dimensional layers. Novel device concepts, with deep roots in&lt;br/&gt;proven ideas (modulation doping and resonant tunneling), uniquely take advantage of the&lt;br/&gt;material properties. Implementation of the concepts incorporates realistic engineering&lt;br/&gt;considerations from materials and processing to structures and modeling, and represents sound&lt;br/&gt;engineering practice.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: New discoveries will be introduced to undergraduate and graduate students, not&lt;br/&gt;only to convey knowledge, but also to stimulate curiosity and enthusiasm. Outreach activities&lt;br/&gt;such as the PI's partnership with a local high school will impact K-12 science and math&lt;br/&gt;education. The nature of the proposed research provides an excellent multidisciplinary research&lt;br/&gt;platform for graduate students. This project will enhance diversity by involving and training&lt;br/&gt;female graduate students and by recruiting young minds from underrepresented groups. The&lt;br/&gt;success of this research will potentially create US jobs by complementing the dominant, largely&lt;br/&gt;overseas silicon-based fabrication with graphene-based niche technologies.</AbstractNarration>
