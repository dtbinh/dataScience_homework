    <AbstractNarration>Public policy and system engineering for cyber security depend on effective techniques for assessing and comparing architectures, designs, algorithms, protocols, implementations and performance within hostile and malicious operating environments. This workshop is to advance a general approach to predictive measurement for cyber security and information assurance based on work factor analysis. Various frameworks for analysis will be adduced across classes of algorithms, systems and architectures and application areas. The aim of these frameworks include enabling market mechanisms for security based on sound metrics, assessing the resilience of critical infrastructure against nation-state threats, and evaluating the effectiveness of asymmetric cyber operations against adaptive organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will raise awareness across the many communities increasingly involved with cybersecurity and will encourage greater participation in discussion of critical issues at the intersection of public policies for cybersecurity and science of security.</AbstractNarration>
