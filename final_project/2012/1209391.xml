    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Christiana Chang of University of Houston to conduct a research project, entitled "Effects of temperature on electronic plastic sensors," during the summer of 2012 at Chiba University in Chiba, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. The host scientist is Professor Ning Hu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the development and experimental verification of accurate numerical models of carbon nanoparticle enhanced polymers, an emerging class of multifunction materials which can be used for sensing applications. This research contributes to basic understanding of the sensing mechanism working principles and in the design of such materials for the development of highly sensitive, robust, structurally integrated carbon based sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
