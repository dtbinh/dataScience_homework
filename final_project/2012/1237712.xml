    <AbstractNarration>Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a single genotype to produce different behaviors and body forms (phenotypes) when exposed to different environmental conditions. Phenotypic plasticity is rapidly gaining traction as a driver of evolutionary change. This symposium, to take place at the 2012 Animal Behavior Society meeting, has two major goals. The first is to bring together senior scientists studying the role of behavioral plasticity in evolution, with younger scientists taking new approaches to the field. A second goal is to begin a major discussion about the role of behavioral plasticity in the early responses of populations to Human Induced Rapid Environmental Change (HIREC). The symposium therefore includes those interested in basic, theoretical approaches to understanding the role of behavioral plasticity in evolution and those interested in applications and should facilitate advances in understanding of the roles of plasticity in evolution from both theoretical and applied perspectives. Among the broader impacts stemming from this funding will be the inclusion (and funding) of doctoral and post-doctoral scholars conducting research on behavioral plasticity in a linked poster session to be attended by symposium participants, and related keynote and plenary address speakers. Turner Scholars (undergraduate participants at the ABS meeting supported by NSF) will also shadow the speakers during the linked poster session, including them in discussions. The symposium should also result in the generation of new ideas that will enhance our ability to predict and understand the ways in which HIREC is likely to force the evolution or extinction of species - with a particular focus on the role of behavioral plasticity in this process. The goal is to be able to anticipate situations in which intervention is essential to prevent the extinction of vulnerable species, and to avoid/prevent evolutionary transitions that result in loss of unique population phenotypes without extinction.</AbstractNarration>
