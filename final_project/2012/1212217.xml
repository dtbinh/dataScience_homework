    <AbstractNarration>The C-Band All Sky Survey (C-BASS) is a radio survey at 5 GHz of the entire sky in total intensity and linear polarization. The northern part of the survey will be completed in 2012 using a cryogenic receiver, optimized for both total intensity and linear polarization, on a 6.1-meter antenna at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. A parallel southern survey will be conducted in 2012-2013 using a similar receiver on a 7.6-meter antenna in South Africa. This award supports the completion of the northern survey and the publication and interpretation of the results. The C-BASS will be the first all-sky survey of diffuse Galactic emission at a frequency low enough to be dominated by synchrotron radiation but high enough to be uncorrupted by Faraday rotation effects. It will provide new information about the interstellar medium, the Galactic magnetic field, and radiation mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;The C-BASS data are also needed to improve the separation of the polarized cosmic microwave background (CMB) from foreground emission. The CMB polarization is measured by the WMAP and Planck satellites, and by several current and future ground-based and balloon-borne experiments. A major goal for these experiments is to measure the B-mode polarization signal, which is expected to provide information about the epoch of inflation - in particular, the energy scale of inflation - and about physics at grand unification energies. This requires that the CMB is separated from foreground emission with higher accuracy than it is possible with our current understanding of Galactic foregrounds. The C-BASS data will significantly improve the accuracy of foreground subtraction. &lt;br/&gt;The survey is conducted in collaboration with groups at the Universities of Oxford and Manchester (UK), Rhodes University and HartRAO (South Africa), and KACST (Saudi Arabia). The receiver for the northern survey has been constructed and deployed at OVRO with support from the NSF and Oxford and Manchester universities. Construction of the southern receiver has been supported by Oxford, Manchester, and KACST. The The C-BASS sky maps will be made freely available soon after completion. Students are involved in the design and construction of the instrumentation as well as the observations and data analysis. Members of the C-BASS team participate in the development and execution of broad outreach programs at The Owens Valley Radio Observatory.</AbstractNarration>
