    <AbstractNarration>This project plans to combine two capabilities, the tunable atom-like electronic quantum states of nanostructured materials and ultrashort-pulsed laser sources based on fiber-optics, to provide a route to making nanostructure materials economically and efficiently. The versatility of this approach is a major driver of the project: condensation of nanoparticles from a femtosecond laser-generated plasma can produce nanoparticles of essentially any material deposited as a thin film, including semiconductors and different kinds of metals that are useful for energy-critical applications. This versatility is the key to developing a wide range of applications for a variety of users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research may provide a new route to achieving the goal of inexpensively fabricating nanopartical films in sufficient density and quantity or industrial-scale applications. Sustainable, environmentally friendly, affordable, energy supply is challenge facing today's society. New materials development can be essential to this task; for example, efficient solar energy harvesting, by catalytic splitting of water molecules or by photovoltaic power generation could benefit greatly from cost-effective materials for utilizing renewable energy. Research conducted through this project may serve as the basis for a scalable technological solution to the need for energy-critical materials.</AbstractNarration>
