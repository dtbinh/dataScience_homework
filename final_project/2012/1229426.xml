    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA), Professor Arthur Utz from Tufts University and colleagues Terry Haas, Elena Rybak-Akimova, Clay Bennett and Samuel Thomas will acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) mechanism-based design of selective, efficient, switchable receptors and catalysts for oxidations and other small molecule activation reactions; (b) design of functional organic materials; (c) design and development of catalysts for regioselective and enantioselective synthetic methods; (d) design of nanomaterials and nanocatalysts; (e) intermolecular interactions and self-assembly in fluorinated biomolecules; (f) functional polymer materials; (g) single molecules on surfaces; (h) biomimetic protein-based materials; and (i) design of cyclic peptides with enhanced affinity and selectivity of binding to their targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research not only at Tufts University but also in a series of Boston area primarily undergraduate institutions that include Bridgewater State University, Emmanuel College and Suffolk University. Outreach to Braintree High School students and to deaf undergraduate students is being planned.</AbstractNarration>
