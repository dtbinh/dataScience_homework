    <AbstractNarration>This study will examine how animals have been depicted in the popular science magazine, National Geographic between 1888-2008. The evolving visual depiction of animals will be interpreted, taking into account scientific changes, natural history, environmental history, and the new aesthetic sensibilities provided by the history of landscape and environmental photography and by situating the magazine and its photographers, editors and photographic conventions in their broader historical, cultural and political contexts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will result in two end products: 1) a digital archive and discussion forum on animal meaning and conservation using a sample of National Geographic images and the Personal Meaning Map methodology which will be made available on the web with teaching and learning exercises through Michigan State University?s MATRIX/KORA Digital Repository and Publishing Platform (to establish a pedagogical tool in animal conservation for a broad audience, including students and scholars) and 2) an illustrated monograph on animal imagery in National Geographic (to advance interdisciplinary scholarship by connecting National Geographic representations of animals to broad historical shifts in science, culture, politics and media conventions).</AbstractNarration>
