    <AbstractNarration>An award was made to the Biology Department at Tufts University to provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students per year, for the summers of 2013-2015. The summer program is entitled, " Integrative approaches to studying recognition systems in cells, organisms, and populations" and will provide students the opportunity to work closely on collaborative, interdisciplinary projects combining faculty expertise in biochemistry, genetics, development, endocrinology, neurobiology, animal behavior, plant ecology, and conservation biology. Students will work with two mentors, one serving as the primary mentor, to combine research techniques from different fields to design and conduct an independent project. In addition to research involvement, the program includes weekly discussions, seminars, field trips, and a student symposium. The goals of this summer program are to increase students' proficiency in biological research and collaborative skills, to educate and inspire students toward future research careers, and to develop students' ability to effectively communicate scientific results. Accordingly, seminars are focused on proficiency in science/communication of scientific results, scientific ethics/responsible conduct of research, and career development. We select our participants from a broad undergraduate applicant pool, and the program is committed to providing research opportunities for students traditionally underrepresented in science and those who might not have such opportunities at their home institutions (with an emphasis on community college students). The Tufts University Department of Biology has a long-standing commitment to mentoring undergraduates in research, and a strong track record of highly productive interdisciplinary research collaborations. Student-mentor relationships typically extend long beyond the research experience and are facilitated via electronic networking tools. The participants provide frequent feedback on the program, and thus take an active role in refining the approach. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool.
