    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to study the radiation sensing mechanism enabled by functional material matrices that combine highly efficient electron-hole pair collecting materials with radiation sensitive materials. The approach is based on the fabrication of semiconductor junction photodetectors in the shape of vertically oriented pillars that will be embedded in functional radiation sensitive materials such as enriched boron. The relation between the detection efficiency and device parameters such as pillar dimensions, inter-pillar distances, surface planarity and low resistance contacts for optimum charge transfer at the interface of the pillars and the radiation sensing materials will be established. The strain present in the material matrices under different growth conditions will be studied to minimize the interface stresses. The study will also include advanced surface passivation techniques such as hydrothermal growth of enriched boron compounds around the pillar detectors to simultaneously act as passivation coatings as well as neutron sensitive materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this research, if successful, will lead to highly efficient, lightweight, low-cost and large area solid-state radiation sensors. Such devices will offer alternatives to helium isotopes that are currently being used in conventional neutron detectors and are facing a looming supply shortage, in addition to the disadvantages such as susceptibility to microphonics, high operational voltage, high pressure and poor fieldability due to large footprint. Through the applications of manufacturing processes used by the semiconductor industry, the research offers the potential to enable a new class of advanced radiation sensing systems that can be integrated with high-speed read-out electronics for applications in particle physics, homeland security, non-proliferation, neutron radiography and material characterization. Educational and outreach programs based on this research will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science and technology and train future multidisciplinary scientists and engineers through an active collaboration with the National Laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
