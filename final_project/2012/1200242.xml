    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to advance switching control theory and to develop competitive nonlinear control techniques. There are many switched systems emerging recently in engineering practices that involve interactions between continuous time and discrete event dynamics. Switched systems provide a useful mechanism to model complex dynamics that are subject to abrupt parameter variations and sudden changes in system configurations. Using multiple and conjugate Lyapunov functions, this effort will investigate new switching control techniques with different switching rules to improve controlled performance and expand control design capability. Another focus of the research is to generate computationally efficient algorithms tailored to an important class of non-convex problems arising from switching control designs. This research will make fundamental contributions by developing switching control schemes to handle modeling inaccuracy and actuator nonlinearity and generating effective computational tools from combined deterministic and probabilistic perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The application of the projected switching control techniques and software tools to hypersonic aircraft could realize the full potential of ultrahigh speed aircraft flight, which has critical implications for both defense and commercial applications. The outcome of the research would have significant commercial, defense, and national security impacts. The success of this project can serve as a catalyst for the widespread use of theoretically sound and practically useful switching control approaches in engineering applications. The educational and outreach activities will enhance North Carolina State University's educational program by generating undergraduate research opportunities and facilitate university-industry collaboration and technology transfer.</AbstractNarration>
