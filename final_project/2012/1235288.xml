    <AbstractNarration>1235288&lt;br/&gt;Rosario-Ortiz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic of emerging trace organic contaminants (TrOC) has gained widespread attention from the scientific community and the public over the past ten years. These TrOC are associated with anthropogenic activities and include endocrine disruptor compounds, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, industrial chemicals, and others. Numerous studies have been conducted on the source, occurrence and removal of these compounds from wastewater effluents (mostly focusing on the efficacy of engineered systems such as advanced oxidation and membranes). These TrOC enter the environment via wastewater discharges, where significant ecological effects are being observed. However, the role of natural decay processes within wastewater-impacted streams has received less attention. Within these decay processes, the role of indirect photolysis through the hydroxyl radical (HO-) is of interest due to the high reactivity of this species, which will result in significant degradation of TrOCs. Recently, the role of organic matter as an important contributor to the photochemical formation of HO- has been recognized. However, there is no information on the capacity of wastewater-derived effluent organic matter (EfOM) to form HO- or potential variability as a function of EfOM sub-components. Therefore, the main objective of this proposal is to examine the photochemical formation of HO- from EfOM. To accomplish this objective, the PI will study the fundamental processes by which EfOM form HO- and the impact of environmental factors and composition of EfOM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will expand the basic understanding of how wastewater discharge affect photolytic processes involving TrOC, which will allow engineers and scientists to improve the understanding of natural decay processes. In addition, the results could be used to enhance water quality models related to fate of TrOC in urban watersheds. The PI will also work to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities (URM) in engineering degrees by leveraging the universal appeal of the issue of water sustainability. To accomplish this, the PI will develop a seminar series, which will target undergraduate students at the University of Colorado, Boulder (CU Boulder). These seminars will be developed in collaboration with the Gold Shirt program at CU Boulder and will help prepare students for participation in research activities. In addition, the educational plan will include the participation of one graduate student in an ongoing GK-12 program.</AbstractNarration>
