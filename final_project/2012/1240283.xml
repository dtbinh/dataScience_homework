    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides support for the EcoCAR 2: Plugging into the Future Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition. The NSF will provide support for the ?EcoCAR 2 NSF Outstanding Faculty Advisory Awards?. EcoCAR 2 is a new three year collegiate advanced vehicle technology engineering competition jointly sponsored by the NSF, United States Department of Energy, Natural Resources Canada, the automotive industry (General Motors) and suppliers such as Cisco Systems, Mathworks, A123, dSPACE, Freescale Semiconductor, Caterpillar, etc.), and is managed by the Argonne National Laboratory. This is a continuation of the highly successful educational experience for undergraduate students at US and Canadian universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This competition challenges fifteen universities across North America to explore solutions to minimize energy consumption and reduce emissions while designing comfortable, safe, road-vehicles commercially viable vehicles. At the conclusion of each year of EcoCAR2, all fifteen teams will get together for a week long competition were they will be competing for the coveted first place trophy.</AbstractNarration>
