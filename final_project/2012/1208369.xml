    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to search for new fossil localities in eastern Uganda to understand the evolutionary processes associated with the origin of hominoids, the group of primates that includes apes and humans. The few known fossil sites in this area have yielded ancient animal and plant communities that include fossils of the oldest known apes. One of these apes,"Morotopithecus," shows evidence of using an upright trunk, the earliest known precursor of bipedalism in humans. Fossil data relevant to human origins is rare and evidence of such evolutionary specializations in apes provides critical insights into our evolution in Africa. Eastern Uganda represents one of the few known areas in the world where evidence has been found and further discoveries are essential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Although the general locations of known fossil sites were established over 50 years ago, there have been no systematic attempts to explore this area for fossil localities. This has been due to the remote nature of this region, rugged terrain, large areas to reconnoiter (over 500 km2), heavy vegetation during all but the two-month dry season, limited geologic maps, and political instability related to armed livestock raiding. A recent national disarmament campaign has led to improved safety as well as the establishment of new settlements and access roads. Using newly available high-resolution satellite imagery, an extensive survey will be conducted (during the critical dry season) for fossiliferous sediments for the first time, possibly resulting in new sites and new fossils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broader impacts of this project include fostering of the career of women paleontologists, who are under-represented in field projects, as well as fostering the careers of African scholars in the form of collaborators and students. Researchers will disseminate their science widely through timely publication, teaching, the training of museum staff and public lectures.</AbstractNarration>
