    <AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to Sanford Research/USD in collaboration with Augustana College to provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2013-2015. The Augustana College REU Site in Cell and Molecular Biology focuses on cell and molecular biology, with hypothesis-driven projects that include investigation of cell signaling events via characterization of macromolecular interactions and proteomic, genomic, and metabolomic changes across a variety of model organisms. REU students will directly contribute to the understanding of these areas of research. Sanford Research and Augustana College have 19 research mentors with exciting, hands-on projects that range from neuroscience to yeast biology. Each project allows students to learn modern molecular methods. Students will also gain valuable experience by attending career development workshops that cover professional integrity in research, the graduate school application process, careers in science, GRE-preparation, the importance of increasing diversity in research, and how to balance family and career. Students will give an oral presentation of their project at the beginning of the summer, a poster presentation at the end of the summer, and are encouraged to present at and attend national meetings. REU students will be exposed to the cutting-edge facilities and equipment that are housed amongst the various departments and cores at Sanford Research and Augustana College. Recruitment is carried out directly via faculty mentor visits to the students' institutions and attendance at undergraduate conferences, along with email and social media, with an aim to reach out to students who would not usually be exposed to such an opportunity. Students are selected based upon academic record, work ethic, scientific potential, and evidence of enthusiasm for participating in cell and molecular biology research. Upon completion of the program, alumni are surveyed to measure the influence that participation in the program had on their academic performance, scientific interests, and long-term career path. The REU common assessment tool at www.bioreu.org will be used to evaluate program impacts.
