    <AbstractNarration>ETR Associates will design and test a near-peer strategy, called CSteach, for infusing Computer Science (CS) content and the connection between CS and the social good into K-12 technology programming curriculum. Effective strategies for engaging Latino/a students in computer science (CS) require an increased focus on the societal implications of computing. CSteach employs a multigenerational approach where trained high school students (near-peers) facilitate a weekly afterschool class where they provide instruction and role modeling to 5th grade students. The goals are to create a sustainable and scalable network that will increase the interest and capacity of Latino/a students to pursue computer science. Intended outcomes include increased knowledge and support systems of 5th grade and high school students to pursue computer science classes and careers. External evaluation will monitor project progress toward these goals and assess changes in students? and teachers? knowledge and attitudes. The project builds on the exemplary practices of the Watsonville TEC program, the Computing Alliance for Hispanic Serving Institutions, and the Global Information Internship Program at UC Santa Cruz. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSteach will contribute to our understanding of the teaching and learning of computing K-12 students. The scalable curriculum and training materials produced as a result of this project will help leverage Latino students' existing interest in computing. The program will be culturally relevant, but the advanced computing concepts and connection to the social good will be applicable to other groups.</AbstractNarration>
