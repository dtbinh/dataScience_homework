    <AbstractNarration>The ubiquitousness of massive data sets presents&lt;br/&gt;great challenges. The difficulty of dealing with massive data&lt;br/&gt;sets is especially formidable when attempting to&lt;br/&gt;solve computational problems in which both the inputs&lt;br/&gt;and the outputs to the computation are large.&lt;br/&gt;In such a situation, it would be useful if one could find&lt;br/&gt;faster ways of computing just the portion of the output that is required&lt;br/&gt;by the user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to study "local computation algorithms",&lt;br/&gt;namely algorithms that quickly compute only the portions of the&lt;br/&gt;output that are required by the user,&lt;br/&gt;without performing the full computation.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, local computation algorithms&lt;br/&gt;view only a miniscule portion of the input.&lt;br/&gt;The PI considers a broad based approach, studying the application of&lt;br/&gt;local computation algorithms to a range of problems and&lt;br/&gt;settings within algorithm design.&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research is on the question of when local computations&lt;br/&gt;can be done in time that is sub-linear in the size of the input and output.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will develop techniques for constructing&lt;br/&gt;such algorithms and for understanding when such algorithms are&lt;br/&gt;not possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will leverage known results from sub-linear time&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, which for the most part have focused on the somewhat&lt;br/&gt;different setting of computational&lt;br/&gt;problems in which the inputs are large but the outputs are small.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the project will investigate well-studied&lt;br/&gt;classes of algorithmic techniques and focus on modifying them for&lt;br/&gt;use in this new setting. Such classes include algorithmic techniques&lt;br/&gt;first developed for parallel and distributed algorithms, as well as the&lt;br/&gt;extensively used greedy method.&lt;br/&gt;Problems from combinatorial optimization, graph theory and compressibility&lt;br/&gt;of strings will be studied.</AbstractNarration>
