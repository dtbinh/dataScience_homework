    <AbstractNarration>Network simulation continues to be an indispensable tool for performance evaluation of wireless network protocol stacks for it's ability to explore fine-grained causal input-output relations and network scalability aspects, that cannot be readily studied by other means. This project will add much needed ingredients to ns-3 (the most commonly used open source simulation tool for networking research) and extend its capabilities beyond those in comparable commercial tools in important ways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Network simulation methodologies face a fundamental dilemma - increased realism only comes with greater simulator complexity. The pathways proposed provide the best, most realistic approaches to achieving a proper balance. The agenda broadly concentrates on a new wireless protocol stack library that efficiently incorporates cross-layer design approaches that capture the coupling between parameters at Layers 1-2 and protocol elements at Layers 3-4. Further, coupled simulation-emulation approaches that balance the flexibility of the former (software simulation) with the fidelity of the latter (testbed or emulator) will enable new design and performance analysis techniques. All freeware will be disseminated via the ns-3 website (www.nsnam.org) under usual GPL and publicized via tutorials at conferences and workshops.</AbstractNarration>
