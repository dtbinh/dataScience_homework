    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Vitaly Kresin's group from the University of Southern California will introduce an approach for manipulating the orientation, reactions, self-assembly, and surface deposition of very cold polar molecules by the application of an external field. This will be achieved by embedding the molecules into superfluid helium nanodroplets in a beam. The droplets cool the molecules to sub-Kelvin temperatures without impeding their ability to migrate and rotate freely. An externally imposed electric field will produce nearly complete molecular alignment. This novel route to explore and control quantum phenomena will be applied to the following areas: (i) Steering the outcome of molecular reactions and assembly via imposing a mutual orientation on the reactants; (ii) Nanodroplet size selection via electrostatic deflection of droplets doped with polar molecules. (iii) Soft-landing of aligned polar molecules via application of a directed electric field near a substrate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, quantum-level control of cold and ultracold polar molecule assembly, interactions and reactions has attracted significant interdisciplinary interest in view of their potential value for quantum computing, novel condensate phases, molecular interferometry, and investigations of fundamental symmetries. Potential applications of the deposition technique include production of oriented films and arrays, enhanced optical sensing, etc. On the human resources side, the project will offer graduate students excellent training in a wide range of experimental and theoretical aspects of an inherently interdisciplinary field. Postdoctoral researchers will receive professional mentoring. Commitment to teaching and outreach includes ongoing active undergraduate student involvement in research, as well as contributions to programs and workshops for undergraduate, elementary-school, and high-school students.</AbstractNarration>
