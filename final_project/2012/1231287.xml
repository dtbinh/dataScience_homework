    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the fundamental research on a novel centrifugal spinning process that is capable of producing polymer, carbon, ceramic, and composite nanofibers at high speed and low cost. Centrifugal spinning eliminates the limitations encountered by current nanofiber production methods. In this research, the foundation of the novel centrifugal spinning process will be established through the fundamental understanding of the nanofiber formation process and the processing-structure relationships. Guidelines for producing nanofibers of polymers, carbons, ceramics, and composites will be established, and the processing-structure relationships obtained in this work can be used to guide the design of advanced nanofiber materials for a wide variety of potential applications including batteries, fuel cells, solar cells, biocatalysts, purification, sensors, composites, and protonic and electronic microdevices. In this work, the potential use of centrifugally-spun nanofibers in batteries and fuel cells will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will lead to a new centrifugal spinning process that can produce nanofibers of many different materials, which have significant impacts on a broad range of applications. Nanofibers of polymers, carbons, ceramics, and composites will be obtained. The exploration of potential applications, especially in energy storage and conversion, will help alleviate foreign oil dependence, improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable development. In addition, emerging research concepts, theories, and technologies relevant to the proposed work will be implemented in classroom teaching to accurately reflect the changing trends in the profession, and produce students with the skills needed to participate in and advance novel processing and manufacturing technologies. These research and education activities will also help the United State stay in the leading position in these strategic fields.</AbstractNarration>
