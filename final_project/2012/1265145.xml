    <AbstractNarration>The shape memory alloy (SMA) thermal energy harvesting technology developed through this project is a clean, robust, and economic mechanism that bridges the thermal, material, mechanical, and electrical domains to convert virtually any source of heat into electricity. With a recently developed prototype, temperature fluctuations that are occur daily almost everywhere on earth drive contractions and elongations of SMA elements. These in turn force rotation of a shaft that is connected to a generator, producing electricity that can be stored or used immediately. As such, the SMA device has numerous advantages over alternative methods of electricity generation. The SMA energy harvesting device is not dependent upon direct sunlight as are solar panels nor does it require directional wind or water flow like wind turbines and hydroelectric dams. Hence, the SMA device can be efficaciously installed virtually anywhere on earth because it relies solely upon temperature oscillations. Finally, the SMA energy harvesting device has the ability to be deployed in many configurations and orientations on, above or below ground or even underwater. Thus, negative ecological impacts can be minimized in comparison to hydroelectric dams, coal, wind turbines, and nuclear facilities that are used to generate electricity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SMA device should not directly contribute to global warming or pollution which is a substantial advantage over coal, natural gas, and nuclear sources of electricity generation. The number of potential users for a mid-sized version of this product is immense, ranging from people in underdeveloped nations to people in urban locations. This device could also be used by small and large-scale companies to help reduce annual energy expenditures. Additionally, individuals and companies that use this device can generate their own electricity during power outages that occur during storms.</AbstractNarration>
