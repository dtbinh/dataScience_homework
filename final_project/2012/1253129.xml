    <AbstractNarration>This project tests whether streams and lakes in the Big Thicket National Preserve (BTNP) in East Texas harbor a higher diversity of animal species than streams and lakes in surrounding, unprotected areas. This will be accomplished via a comprehensive survey of the parasites of fishes in the BTNP and the surrounding area that encompasses the historical range of the Big Thicket. Parasites will be utilized as indicator species for overall biodiversity and community interactions, and is expected to include at least 220 parasite species from 8 animal groups and at least 95 species of fishes.&lt;br/&gt;The project will greatly accelerate discovery of new species in an area under intense human pressure, provide critical, informative tests of the utility of conservation preserves in protecting natural ecosystems, and will help inform future decisions regarding conservation design and protection of natural resources. In addition, the project will enhance the nation's public museum holdings of parasite and fish specimens (at least 1,600 new lots of specimens), enhance infrastructure for research and education of students in STEM disciplines at a small, rural college, provide opportunities and effective avenues for student advancement towards careers in the sciences, and contribute to ongoing research and conservation endeavors, including the Big Thicket All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory coordinated by the National Park Service.</AbstractNarration>
