    <AbstractNarration>The proposed planning activity seeks to establish a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) site at Iowa State University of the existing Center for e-Design. The center currently involves six universities -Virginia Tech as lead, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the University of Central Florida, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Buffalo, and Brigham Young University. The specific needs within the Center to be met by Iowa State University are focused in the following areas: 1) information technology strategies and optimization of products and systems, 2) design education and training, 3) early stage design theories and methodologies, 4) robotics and sensor integration, 5) materials, manufacturing and design, and 6) design for sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed new site, in combination with the existing center plans to build innovation capacity by developing methods and tools that support the realization of new virtual simulation and design paradigms for development of new engineered products and systems. The outcomes from the center have the potential to broadly impact the public and private sectors through impact on manufacturing. The site plans to have a significant impact on students via a broad range of mechanism from curriculum to design experiences. The PI and other Iowa State faculty have a documented history of recruiting women and minority graduate and undergraduate students. Research and educational findings will be disseminated nationally and have significant broader impact through industrial collaboration and technology transfer.</AbstractNarration>
