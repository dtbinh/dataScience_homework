    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Jessica Lundin of University of Washington to conduct a research project, entitled "Improving Greenland ice-core chronologies," during the summer of 2012 at University of Hokkaido in Hokkaido. The host scientist is Professor Ralf Greve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to improve the chronology of the Greenland Ice-sheet Project (GISP2) ice core. An accurate chronology is necessary to make accurate inferences about the past climate, including changes in temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric composition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
