    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1206745 PI: Winter, Jessica ORG: Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Micellular Electrospray Synthesis of Magnetic Quantum Dots&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: This research will examine new synthesis routes to unite quantum dots and magnetic nanoparticles. These magnetic quantum dots are fluorescent and respond to a magnetic field and could thus be used in a variety of applications, including multimodal imaging, separations, and studies of the role of force in cell function. These nanocomposites will be produced by combining a bottom up assembly strategy (micellular self-assembly) with a top down process (electrohydrodynamic spraying). In the proposed approach, electrospray will generate continuous, uniform, large surface area emulsion droplets that will be transformed to micelles via their interfacial instability with water. Because the morphology of electrospray particles is tightly controlled, micellular electrospray should enable greater process control and improved particle uniformity, reproducibility, and scale. Given that electrospray has not previously been used to examine micellular structures, we will first explore the influence of reaction conditions on empty micelle production, and then investigate the influence of nanoparticle loading on micelles. Particles produced will be characterized through single nanocomposite analysis techniques. Single particle magnetic characterization at the nanoscale has not previously been demonstrated. This approach could be applied to virtually any hydrophobic structure smaller than the micelle core, thus producing a wide variety of nanocomposites. These studies will also increase understanding of micelle-nanoparticle assemblies, which are distinct from empty micelles or micelles encapsulating molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: This research will be executed by diverse teams of graduate, undergraduate, and high school researchers. Research results will be disseminated through a unique educational strategy that combines teaching and outreach to develop course materials and experimental demonstrations for K-14 students. Additionally, the proposed work will be incorporated into an educational video game developed by non-profit partner EdHeads to increase K-12 STEM and nanotechnology awareness.</AbstractNarration>
