    <AbstractNarration>Center for Child Injury Prevention Studies (CChIPS) &lt;br/&gt;Proposal # 1230312 &lt;br/&gt;Flaura Winston &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Child Injury Prevention Studies (CChIPS) located at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concussions (also known as mild traumatic brain injuries - mTBI) are not only the most common injury sustained by children in crashes but often lead to poor outcomes that affect a child's quality of life. Understanding the biomechanics of mTBI for children goes beyond automotive injury prevention and advances a CChIPS strategic goal of expansion into sports injury prevention. This Fundamental Research proposal addresses industrys need for data to drive safety innovation on preventing mTBI in children. The primary objectives in this proposed research are to: 1) validate the ability of helmet-based sensors to measure the head acceleration of a helmeted youth hockey player and 2) quantify the head biomechanics experienced by youth hockey players across a typical season and correlate these to measured neurocognitive deficits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By providing an in-depth understanding of injury mechanisms and injury metrics associated with concussion linked with medical data, this research will lead to new ATD (anthropometric test device), injury criteria and testing protocols. These new tools will fuel the cycle of product development for technology to prevent mTBI in children both for the automotive and sports equipment industries. The proposed work will contribute novel data relating engineering metrics to neurological and cognitive outcomes associated with head impacts to the pre-adolescent. This project also facilitates creation of an international site of CChIPS in Sweden and provides a platform for attracting new members from the sports injury prevention industry.</AbstractNarration>
