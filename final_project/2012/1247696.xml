    <AbstractNarration>Big data analytics is, fundamentally, the problem of bringing the massive amounts of data produced today down to human scale. In particular scientists, engineers, physicians, and many others in knowledge-intensive professions face data that is beyond human scale. This data is in the repositories that collect the data and the reports or results in their fields. This project will address the problem of bringing all this knowledge under control by using even more data, namely the individual and social patterns of how these repositories are accessed and used, and user-specific judgments (valuations) of the data. The proposed research will develop novel algorithms and an open-source infrastructure for improving discovery within and access to data repositories. These algorithms will aggregate and analyze the social analytic data, gathered from professional communities of data users, and will motivate them to participate by providing recommendations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The transformative goal is to develop methods for organizing, and operationalizing the access and preference patterns of users of large repositories, and for integrating those valuations to accelerate discovery within the collections. Diverse human minds interacting with data collections, as they carry out their own research or operational activities, provide a powerful source of information about the value of the data itself. Those data items may be textual documents, numerical datasets, or other kinds of media content. The novel methods for representing, aggregating, organizing and valuating interactions between the users and the items can reveal structures within data collections, which were previously invisible to any individual. This discovery of interrelations within data, driven by the capture of human intelligence, will accelerate the processes of scientific discovery. Users who are permitted to valuate data, and who are motivated by receiving valuable recommendations in return, reveal more about their own interests. This makes it possible to discover relations among the data items and among the users themselves. The educational goals are to: (a) contribute to the education of specific graduate students supported by the project, and undergraduates via the REU mechanism; (b) generate new educational materials related to algorithmic innovations, and to research findings; and (c) improve access to and discovery within specific collections of materials. Research findings will be included in courses at all three collaborating universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional information about the project (including publication, software, data sets) will be made available through the project web site: http://arxiv_xs.rutgers.edu/.</AbstractNarration>
