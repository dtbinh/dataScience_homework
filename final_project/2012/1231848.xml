    <AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is to establish transformative methodology and novel&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for secure communications in spectrum sharing cognitive radio networks to&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously maximize the secrecy throughput of secondary users under security&lt;br/&gt;threats, ensure the quality of service for primary users, and keep information secret to&lt;br/&gt;eavesdroppers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is: 1) to propose a unified network model to describe the fading&lt;br/&gt;cognitive radio network that has multiple primary users, secondary users and&lt;br/&gt;eavesdroppers, all connected by wireless fading channels; 2) to formulate the secure&lt;br/&gt;communication of secondary users into direct maximization of mutual information or&lt;br/&gt;throughput with finite-alphabet (rather than Gaussian) signaling and channel statistics&lt;br/&gt;constraints; 3) to present a novel approach to solving the neither concave nor convex&lt;br/&gt;optimization problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include: 1) this project will bridge the gap between network&lt;br/&gt;information theory and practical network implementation by employing finite-alphabet&lt;br/&gt;signaling and channel statistics to optimize linear precoders which maximize the&lt;br/&gt;practically achievable data rates or throughput; 2) it will establish a transformative&lt;br/&gt;methodology that effectively tackles difficult non-concave, non-convex, and nondeterministic&lt;br/&gt;polynomial-time (NP) hard optimization problems in cognitive radio &lt;br/&gt;networks. This methodology can be well applicable to other wireless network settings&lt;br/&gt;such as cooperative relay networks, cellular networks, and wireless sensor and mesh&lt;br/&gt;networks; 3) The research will be timely integrated to collaborations with industrial&lt;br/&gt;partners and education of undergraduate and graduate students, particularly, underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;minority students, thus enhancing the impact to the society via technology innovation.</AbstractNarration>
