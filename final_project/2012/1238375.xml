    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;#1238375&lt;br/&gt;Raveche&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major objective of the proposed research is to employ advanced flow-cytometry-based instrumentation to develop methods and protocols for isolating distinct subpopulations of cells. This in-depth analysis of cell characterizations using fluorescence detection to distinguish 17 or more characteristics simultaneously on individual cells and employing multiple parameters to sort these populations while maintaining the viability of the cells will advance the employment of flow cytometers in biomedical research. The isolation and identification of the cancer progenitor cell is only recently feasible because the technology has evolved such that multiple fluorochromes excited by specific wavelengths emitted from several lasers and unique detectors can sort cells based on multiple markers simultaneously. This requires stable laser lines, careful compensation controls, defined fluidics and sensitive optics and detectors. The hypothesis to be tested is that based on identifiable characteristics, the earliest cancer progenitor cell in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) can be identified.</AbstractNarration>
