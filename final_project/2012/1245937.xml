    <AbstractNarration>This project is creating a suite of learning modules that highlight how mathematics plays a role in understanding issues in sustainability and helping to solve associated problems arising in that area. The modules are designed for use in a stand-alone mode or in concert with one another to form a unit of study stretching across multiple class periods. The units engage students in discovery based learning, including active data collection, and they exploit technology such as the use of Web-based mapping tools on mobile devices. Pilot testing is taking place at a variety of institutions with faculty first attending workshops where they collaboratively create materials. Through the use of established assessment tools the project is adding to the knowledge base of research in STEM undergraduate education by determining factors that address the effectiveness of the modules in improving student knowledge and skills and in changing attitudes about the usefulness of mathematics. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its use of sustainability - a theme that spans the sciences and the social sciences, and affects all individuals in their personal lives and as public citizens, as the motivating context to engage student learning. The project promises broad impact through its involvement of dozens of faculty members at a diverse set of institutions for creating, testing, and subsequent implementation of the modules.</AbstractNarration>
