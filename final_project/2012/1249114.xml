    <AbstractNarration>The PI requests partial support for the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill &amp; Ecosystem Science Conference scheduled for January 21-23, 2013 in New Orleans, LA. This will an open science conference driven by science community input. Topics and speakers for plenary session presentation will be identified by the Conference partners. Through plenary and breakout sessions covering themes ranging from chemical and physical oceanography to ecosystem dynamics and impacts to technology development and public health, the conference will provide a forum for the research community in the Gulf of Mexico to share their latest scientific results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Conference will engage and build a community of researchers working on all aspects of Gulf of Mexico ecosystem science and initiate dialogue with the users of that information. The Conference encourages graduate student participation. The Conference will also involve the participation of high school teachers from the Gulf region to expose them to Gulf ecosystem science, to clarify the science for them, and, ultimately to help advance development of learning opportunities around the science content of the Conference. The conference organizers will engage the four regional Sea Grant programs (FL, LA, MS-AL, TX) and the National Marine Educators Association to conduct outreach to high school teachers affiliated with their local programs and to recruit them for the conference.</AbstractNarration>
