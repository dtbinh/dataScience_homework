    <AbstractNarration>The PI intends to study two basic problems about the large-scale geometry of arithmetic groups: classical arithmetic groups such as SL(n,Z), S-arithmetic groups such as SL(n,Z[1/p]), and function-field-arithmetic groups such as SL(n,F[t]) where F is a finite field. The first problem is to identify the Dehn functions and higher dimensional isoperimetric functions for arithmetic groups. The second is to determine that the cohomology of non-cocompact function-field-arithmetic groups is virtually infinitely generated in the dimension given by the geometric rank of the arithmetic group. The PI also plans to investigate basic open questions for universal lattices - such as SL(n,Z[t]) - and solvable arithmetic groups concerning finiteness properties and word metrics. An investigation of which lattices on CAT(0) complexes are finitely generated is also planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matrices are arrays of numbers. The study of the arithmetic governing the behavior of matrices - a study that mathematics, the physical sciences, and the social sciences have benefited from greatly - is the central focus of the proposed research for this award. The PI proposes to continue the mathematical tradition of bundling the equations that represent the algebra of matrices into a single geometric theory, thus allowing techniques from geometry to deepen our understanding of algebra.</AbstractNarration>
