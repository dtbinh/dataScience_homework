    <AbstractNarration>Rudimentary programming skills are essential to developing fundamental proficiency in computer&lt;br/&gt;science. However, learning programming techniques can be challenging and frustrating for many&lt;br/&gt;students. Without interventions to curb these frustrations, introductory computer science courses will&lt;br/&gt;suffer from attrition and poor retention rates will follow. Drill-and-practice tools are emerging to help&lt;br/&gt;students develop basic programming techniques and improve their confidence. However, there are&lt;br/&gt;currently no programming practice systems that actively and adaptively assist students when they&lt;br/&gt;require help on exercises. Likewise, the potential for peer learning is currently untapped without&lt;br/&gt;effectively leveraging online, social collaboration in practice tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novel approach to organically refine learning materials also offers broader implications for using&lt;br/&gt;automatic assessment in social eLearning environments. We will study students? behaviors with the&lt;br/&gt;system and objectively measure their outcomes. Consequently, our research will offer results associated&lt;br/&gt;with a framework for supporting social and adaptive drill-and-practice. Overall, we expect to improve&lt;br/&gt;student performance and retention in computer science while contributing to the evolution of instructional&lt;br/&gt;technology.</AbstractNarration>
