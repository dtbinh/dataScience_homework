    <AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Daniel Boyanovsky at the University of Pittsburgh. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last two decades have been an exhilarating journey of discovery in particle physics and cosmology. In this project, Professor Boyanovsky will continue his interdisciplinary research in cosmology and particle physics. He will focus on developing a deeper understanding of quantum processes and correlations during the inflationary stage in the early Universe, and study their potential observability in forthcoming measurements. He will also undertake an assessment of neutrinos in extensions beyond the Standard Model as possible dark matter candidates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also likely to have a broader interdisciplinary impact, as Professor Boyanovsky's research involves implementing and merging methods from different branches of physics to study aspects of quantum correlations and entanglement and possible observational consequences both in cosmology and in neutrino physics. He will also mentor a graduate student who will work with him on the goals of this project, and train this graduate student to perform cutting-edge research in particle physics and cosmology.</AbstractNarration>
