    <AbstractNarration>Probation remains the most common disposition for juvenile offenders. The current study explores a multi-stakeholder approach to juvenile probation, highlighting the importance of maintaining positive working relationships among different individuals. The study hypothesizes that the juvenile probation officer (JPO)-youth relationship serves as a primary driving force in juvenile probation and operates as a relationship that can facilitate or impede the probation process. There has been a dearth of research that examines the quality of this relationship, the possible mechanisms that influence it, and its implications for probation outcomes. This study examines how relationship quality between juvenile probation officers and their supervisees predicts supervision, decision-making strategies, and case outcomes; and whether this relationship is moderated by two youth-related variables, namely (a) parent-youth relationship and parents' perceptions of juvenile probation and/or (b) mental health and substance use problems among juvenile probationers. Taking an interdisciplinary approach by bridging theories and practice in psychology, law, and public policy, this study is the first of its kind to examine the quality of JPO-probationer relationship (as perceived by juvenile probationers). At baseline, youth probationers and their parents will participate in a structured interview and JPOs will complete a survey. Six months after baseline, JPOs will complete a brief survey regarding youth compliance to probation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data from this study can potentially inform the development and improvement of evidence-based probation programs and services related to diverse needs of youth on probation. The PIs will partner with juvenile probation programs and will disseminate their findings to both the academic and professional communities.</AbstractNarration>
