    <AbstractNarration>The NCLSAMP project proposes to utilize "promising practices" as well as new program initiatives to achieve the following goals: 1) Increase the pool of competent underrepresented graduates with STEM bachelor's degrees; 2) Promote retention and baccalaureate degree attainment in STEM academic programs, and; 3) Increase the number of students who matriculate into STEM graduate programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase V (Senior-level) NCLSAMP expected outcomes at the end of the project are:&lt;br/&gt;1. An overall average of seventy-five percent (75%) of NCLSAMP participants will be retained in STEM baccalaureate programs within the Alliance. &lt;br/&gt;2. The pool of competent underrepresented graduates with STEM bachelor's degrees will have increased by 10%. &lt;br/&gt;3. The number of NCLSAMP participants who matriculate into STEM graduate programs will have increased by 10%. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building upon its successes in the implementation of cohort-based learning, collaborative instructional approaches and block-scheduling, the Alliance will help its members institutionalize and maintain high impact practices engaging a larger population of underrepresented students into STEM-learning communities. Best practices that will continue and expand based on Phase I experience include Facilitated Study Groups, Research Skills Development Workshops, and Mentored Research Experiences for Undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
