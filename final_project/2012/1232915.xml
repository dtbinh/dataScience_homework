    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to investigate mode coupling in passively isolated systems to provide the theoretical basis for achieving low-cost and energy-efficient reduction of unwanted vibrations in ultra-precision manufacturing machines, which play a central role in advanced manufacturing processes. The research approach involves three main tasks: (1) mathematical characterization of the so-called "critical configurations" induced by mode coupling, as a function of key isolation system design parameters; (2) determination of the mathematical connections among re-leveling controller stability, gravitational stability and mode coupling; and (3) investigation and implementation of optimization schemes that effectively utilize the knowledge gained from Tasks 1 and 2 to methodically select system parameters that ensure optimal vibration reduction without compromising the stability of the isolated system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the knowledge created by this research will enable cutting-edge ultra-precision manufacturing machines to be designed using passive isolators in place of active systems, which can cost up to 90 percent more than passive systems and double the energy consumed to move the machine?s axes. The broader impacts of this research are directed to industry, education and outreach. Collaborations with leading U.S.-based ultra-precision machine manufacturers will enable the results of this research to be transferred to industry. Knowledge from this research will be incorporated into a revamped graduate-level course that aims to equip the next generation of machine tool designers with a mechatronics-based approach to designing manufacturing machines. Finally, a promising but unconventional outreach approach aimed at inspiring underrepresented middle/high school students towards pursuing science/engineering careers by presenting science/engineering careers in their socio-cultural context will be pursued.</AbstractNarration>
