    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Maija Eliina Sipola of The University of Iowa to conduct a research project, entitled "Dating the deposition of Homo erectus-bearing sediments from Java, Indonesia," during the summer of 2012 at Macquarie University in Macquarie Park, NSW, Australia. The host scientist is Dr. Kira Westaway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ngandong paleoanthropological site in Central Java, Indonesia has significant impact on the models for human migration and evolution out of the African continent. Located on a Late Pleistocene fluvial terrace level along the Solo River, paleoanthropological excavations at Ngandong have uncovered fourteen Homo erectus fossils that are believed to possibly be the most recent known occurrences of H. erectus in the world. However, this hypothesis cannot be confirmed by the results of previous studies at Ngandong due to a general lack of understanding of how the site formed. This study seeks to overcome the limits of these previous studies by taking a comprehensive geoarchaeological approach to this site, including specialized methods for luminescence dating. Results of this work are important to geochronologists, geoarchaeologists and paleoanthropologists alike, as well as anyone interested in early human migration and evolution in Southeast Asia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
