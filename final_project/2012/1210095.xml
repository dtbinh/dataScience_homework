    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Dawn Elizabeth Barnes of Emory University to conduct a research project, entitled "how protein structure plays a role in the contraction and relaxation of heart muscle," during the summer of 2012 at Nagoya University in Nagoya, Japan. The host scientist is Yuichiro Maeda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the new knowledge being generated about the mechanism of regulation of heart muscle contraction at the level of single molecules. Using a model system, the nematode C. elegans, allows the use of genetic techniques for studying function of myofilaments in the absence and presence of key proteins. Also being used is cryo-electron microscopy to compare the calcium sensitivity of thin-filament proteins in wild type and mutant forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
