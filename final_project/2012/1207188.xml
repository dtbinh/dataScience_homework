    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polyelectrolyte complexes, molecular blends of positive and negative macromolecules, are generally believed be intractable. This project will explore a new processing technique for producing large-scale, dense polyelectrolyte complexes by employing salt water as a plasticizing agent. The materials are rugged and highly crosslinked with numerous projected applications in the physical and biomedical fields. Several fundamental and practical questions are to be addressed. First to be explored is the idea that salt concentration and temperature are equivalent parameters for influencing the mechanical properties of polyelectrolyte complexes. Such a hypothesis is an extension of the well-known time/temperature superposition principle for viscoelastic materials. Second, methods for toughening dry polyelectrolyte complexes using oligomeric (polyethylene glycol) or polymeric (sulfonated triblock rubbery copolymers) materials will be studied. Finally, the high level of salt supersaturation in the complexes represents an unusually complete degree of mixing of an inorganic material with an organic polymer. The stability of the mixed phases will be evaluated over the long term. The project, employing easily-accessed components, includes international collaborations with researchers at the University of Strasbourg and French government research laboratories. Educational initiatives at Florida State University bringing together Entrepreneurship and Chemistry students will be supported, as will outreach to nearby Albany State College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project exploits a new concept in processing polymers: salt water will be used instead of heat to soften and form plastics. The materials are blends of nontoxic water-soluble polymers, many of them found in personal-care products. These "saloplastics" represent a new class of environmentally friendly recyclable materials that can be used in numerous physical and biomedical applications. International collaborations with the University of Strasbourg, France, will help to unravel the mechanical response of saloplastics to salt water. Methods to toughen saloplastics with unconventional plasticizers will be explored in an effort to make them broadly useful. Saloplastics will be used as a platform to expand a unique educational initiative, started by the PI, pairing Entrepreneurship and Chemistry students at Florida State University, with participation support provided to minority undergraduates from nearby Albany State University.</AbstractNarration>
