    <AbstractNarration>Shifts in food resources are an influential force in the adaptation and evolution of species. This project focuses on the ability of the cactophilic fruit fly, Drosophila mojavensis, to detoxify the toxic compounds that are found in its food resource (necrotic cacti). Drosophila mojavensis is composed of four host races, each of which specializes on a different cactus species. Host races that use different cacti as food resources differ in some genes that appear to have played a role in the cactus specialization. The aim of this project is to quantify the performance of host race-specific alleles of two candidate detoxification genes by using experimental laboratory crosses to insert alleles found in one host race into the other and measuring the effect on performance on necrotic cactus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Improved knowledge of the genetics of resource specialization will increase understanding of the genetic basis of adaptation and the differentiation of species. The project will provide research based training and mentoring to undergraduates through collaboration with the California Alliance for Minority Participation Program. Undergraduates will attend the SACNAS and the Society for the Study of Evolution Conferences, where they will have the opportunity to interact with more senior scientists and present the results of their research.</AbstractNarration>
