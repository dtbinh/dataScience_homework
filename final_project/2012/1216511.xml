    <AbstractNarration>Current wastewater treatment methods consume significant amounts of costly energy, and the efforts to recover energy during treatment have severe limitations. As a result, there is a demand for an integrated system that can simultaneously remove contaminants and produce bioenergy. The proposed technology has the potential to meet this demand by taking advantage of two biological methods: 1) Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) oxidization of organic compounds to generate bioelectricity; and 2) algal bioreactors removing nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) to produce biomass that can be further converted to biodiesel. The project is based on a successful proof-of-concept of the proposed system in the laboratory. The team will assess the commercial viability of the technology through business and engineering development. Successful completion of the project will result in better understanding of key factors needed to determine the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed technology, and help to further engage strategic industrial partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology has economic benefits, including decreased energy consumption and reliance on fossil fuels (coal), and societal benefits including decreased greenhouse gas emissions from energy production and improved water quality. Potential customers for this technology such as publicly-owned water treatment plants, engineering consulting firms, and environmental equipment companies, will help bring the proposed system to market, and will profit from new business opportunities in system design and construction (consulting and equipment), and in reduced operating expenses.</AbstractNarration>
