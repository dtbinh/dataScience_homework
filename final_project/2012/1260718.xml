    <AbstractNarration>Advanced processing and analysis of seismic and bathymetric data will illuminate the record of co-seismic slip associated with the great Tohoku earthquake of 2011. This improved structural imaging should increase understanding of deformation processes, including megasplay behavior, near the toe of the Japan subduction zone including the tsunami source region(s) for the Tohoku event. A step-down in the decollment was recognized at an Integrated Ocean Drilling Program site at the fault and this study will assess the along-strike extent of that structure. In addition to addressing deformation associated with the recent earthquake, results will also address accretionary wedge dynamics at a level of detail not achieved previously, with particular focus on whether sediment erosion versus underplating is occurring.</AbstractNarration>
