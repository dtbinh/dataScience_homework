    <AbstractNarration>SES-1203714&lt;br/&gt;Howard Winant and Samuel Prieto&lt;br/&gt;University of California, Santa Barbara&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral Dissertation Research: Local Political Context and Immigrant Incorporation Strategies &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, states and local governments have begun to implement policies designed to address federal immigration mandates, ranging from attempts to shield immigrants to collaboration with federal agents. In addition, local regulations have affected e.g., immigrant access to housing, social services, and driver?s licenses. In other words, the local political context plays a major role in shaping civic participation on the part of immigrant communities. Comparing two cities in one California county that pursue notably different strategies, this dissertation project asks: How do these different local political environments shape the ways in which immigrants are incorporated into the wider community? The project draws on 50 interviews, as well as extensive on-site observation, to assess the degree to which the local political context shape the strategies of immigrants to participate in local civic life. The political context as defined here includes factors related to electoral politics, the presence and field of community organizations, law enforcement practices, and the choices made by immigrants themselves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Immigration policy is a topic of considerable public interest, as are reform efforts aimed at ensuring the successful social and political integration of immigrants. Findings from this research may be of interest to community organizations and law enforcement. Findings may permit the formulation of a set of ?best practices? of interest to policy makers and law enforcement agencies at local, state, and federal levels.</AbstractNarration>
