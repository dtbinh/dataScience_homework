    <AbstractNarration>The Ohio State University Site of the I/UCRC for Experimental Research in Computer Systems (CERCS) seeks to further build its momentum from its initial phase of operation through a Phase II award. Areas of research thrust for the next phase of the Ohio State CERCS site include development of needed intelligent discovery, visualization, and analysis interfaces for knowledge management, while addressing systems issues like scalability and performance; and development of delivery interfaces that are personalized and persuasive. The site intends to use a virtual ?Living Laboratory? as sandbox environment provisioned by the site?s I/UCRC members that will allow experimentation with existing, heterogeneous ?big data? assets in repositories and enterprise applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge management in the era of big data represents an important area for national competitiveness and one in which industry-university partnerships have the potential to address real-world problems. Working with its Industrial Advisory Board partners, the Ohio State University site of CERCS intends to bring together consumers and technology providers to research new capabilities for knowledge management and collaboration. The Living Lab environment to be used by the site is intended for use by graduate students and undergraduates in order to gain first-hand experience with big-data issues and solutions.</AbstractNarration>
