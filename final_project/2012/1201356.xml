    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of graduate students and postdocs attending the "International Conference on Inverse Problems and PDE Control" that will be held from July 29-August 3, 2012, at Sichuan University in Chengu, China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the conference is on various common techniques used in the study of inverse coefficient problems and control problems for partial differential equations. The tandem of inverse and control problems for partial differential equations constitutes a rapidly growing area of mathematics. In addition to its important theoretical component, it also has significant impact in applied science and engineering, including applications to stabilization, identification and design of physical systems (e.g., quantum control), image processing, mathematical finance, astronomy, geosciences, medical imaging and nondestructive evaluation of materials, among many others. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
