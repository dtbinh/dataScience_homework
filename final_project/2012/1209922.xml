    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Austin Jay Brockmeier of University of Florida to conduct a research project, entitled "Signal processing techniques to separate and analyze brainwaves." during the summer of 2012 at Brain Science Institute RIKEN in Wako-shi, Saitama, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Andrezj Cichocki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the application of recent work on matrix and tensor constrained decomposition methods to separate sources of recurrent patterns and oscillations in local field potential and electroencephalogram data. The primary hypothesis is that these signals can be decomposed as a linear combination of sources with distinct spatio-temporal characteristics, and the revealed sources will serve as sufficient descriptors to classify behavioral or cognitive activity of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
