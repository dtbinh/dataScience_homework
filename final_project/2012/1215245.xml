    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the *mobile platform that offers a radically new alternative to enterprises for application mobilization. The platform enables mobilization without requiring any software development, mobilizes applications instantaneously, offers a uni&amp;#64257;ed mobilization platform for all of an enterprise?s applications, and enables feature parity controllable by the enterprise. Offered as a cloud-based service, enterprises can non-intrusively adopt &amp;#8727;mobile to rapidly mobilize applications. At the heart of the &amp;#8727;mobile platform is an innovative mobile remote computing protocol (MRCP). &amp;#8727;mobile achieves instantaneous mobilization by allowing the desktop version of the application to be run on a cloud backend, and then using MRCP for intelligently and dynamically interfacing the desktop version with a custom viewer on the mobile device. MRCP performs dynamic transformations both in the downstream - where the transformation is applied to the view presented to the user, and in the upstream - where the transformation is applied to the user actions that need to be delivered back to the application. The transformations are performed in an application agnostic fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will benefit the 85% of enterprise knowledge workers who are expected to have smartphones within the next few years (source: J. Gold Assoc., 2011). A recent survey of CIOs revealed that there are multiple drivers for application mobilization - the key ones being increased productivity of employees, higher revenue, and reduced paper work. Not surprisingly, over 90% of IT managers in a recent survey indicated plans for application mobilization (source: Sybase Survey, 2011). Typical customers for &amp;#8727;mobile include any fortune 1000 large enterprise, medium-sized businesses, and small-medium (SMB) businesses that use applications for business processes. While there is a strong and deep need for application mobilization, there exists no universal, cost-effective solution that can perform mobilization rapidly. The current market is highly fragmented with no universal, cost effective, and rapid mobilization solutions available. Thus, there is a need for a solution that can achieve rapid mobilization with minimal effort on the part of the enterprise and at the same time provide the rich set of functionality that the enterprise requires.</AbstractNarration>
