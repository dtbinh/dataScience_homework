    <AbstractNarration>The continuing underrepresentation of women, Blacks and Hispanics in science and engineering occupations impedes efforts to increase the size of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce, a concern for policy makers who view science and scientists as critical to the future of the U.S. economy. Existing research shows that one factor contributing to this underrepresentation is that gains in women's, Blacks' and Hispanics' representation among STEM college majors do not necessarily translate into equal gains in STEM employment. Additionally, women, Blacks, and Hispanics remain far less likely than White or Asian men to be employed in most STEM occupations, particularly outside the life sciences. But little existing research studies trends over time in gender and race-ethnic differences in STEM employment or factors underlying these patterns. The proposed project will use seven waves of the National Science Foundation's (NSF's) Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) to study gender and race-ethnic differences in employment in STEM occupations among college graduates who hold a STEM degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Government spending to educate and train STEM workers is considerable, reaching nearly 900 million by NSF in 2011 (American Institute of Physics, 2010). These investments and the need to increase the numbers of women and underrepresented minority scientists to maintain the future health of the STEM workforce (Burke, 2007; National Science Board, 2010) make retention of STEM workers in related occupations a critical policy issue. This project will enhance the ability of public- and private sector policy makers and program directors to develop and implement practices that encourage the retention of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM occupations.</AbstractNarration>
