    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry and Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, Professor Lagalante at Villanova University and Professor Wolbers at University of Delaware will study the composition, cleaning, and aging of water-borne emulsion polymer (acrylic) paints. Since their introduction in the 1950s, the number of acrylic paintings in major public institutions has grown almost exponentially and represent a significant cultural asset, both in terms of their sheer monetary value and their social, economic, and cultural significance. While acrylic polymer paints have enabled artists to move aesthetically far from the traditional limitations of oil paints, conservators face a cultural legacy replete with some of the greatest challenges in terms of cleaning and preserving these treasures. The collaborative research will 1) investigate the formulation of aqueous microemulsions to remove "model" soils from artificially aged test paints utilizing liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and 3D microscopic imaging to evaluate the cleaning efficacy, 2) investigate the photo-oxidation and speciation of surfactants of aged acrylic films using 2D desorption electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (2D DESI-MS/MS) surface imaging in combination with 2D electron paramagnetic resonance imaging (2D EPRI), and 3) solicit conservator testing of optimized microemulsion cleaning solutions at national and international workshops. The introduction of 2D DESI-MS/MS imaging will be transformative in the museum conservation laboratory for molecular imaging of artwork surfaces as well as find broader applicability for EPR imaging in scientific fields outside the scope of the present proposal. A broad outreach is planned to educate artists, cultural heritage scientists, museum conservators, and paint manufacturers as to the best methods for creating, protecting, exhibiting, and preserving modern painted surfaces.</AbstractNarration>
