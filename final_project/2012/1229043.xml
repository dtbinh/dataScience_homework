    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is to support a three day workshop in inner-model theory and descriptive set theory to be held June 1-3, 2012 at the University of North Texas. The workshop will be held immediately prior to a conference in logic and dynamics to be held at UNT June 4-8, 2012. The workshop will bring together the leading experts in an active and central area of mathematical logic, inner model theory, as well as experts in associated areas of descriptive set theory. The workshop atmosphere should be conducive to an exchange of ideas among the attendees as well as the dissemination of research results and ideas the experts have been working on. By holding the conference in proximity to the logic/dynamics conference, we feel it also has the possibility of attracting an expanded set of participants. Support for the workshop will allow us to support graduate student travel to the workshop and thereby enhance the impact. We will make publicly available the slides and lecture notes from the workshop to further the information exchange. Having the workshop at UNT will enhance the RTG program at UNT and allow the RTG post-docs and graduate students to interact with leaders in related, but different fields of logic. As with the logic/dynamics conference, we will, where possible, seek to increase the presence of women and underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
