    <AbstractNarration>The Machine Learning Summer Schools (http://mlss.cc) were established in 2002 with the aim of bringing together world class speakers from academia, the national labs, and industry to deliver tutorial-style lectures over a two week period. This project supports the two week long Machine Learning Summer School (MLSS) at UC Santa Cruz, CA during July 9-20 2012. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: Machine learning has many important applications in science and industry. Modern machine learning uses a mix of insights from different disciplines, most notably artificial intelligence, statistics and optimization - areas that traditionally have not had much overlap. The participants will take part in tutorials given by experts from several different areas of machine learning - an opportunity that many students do not have at their home institutions. There is substantial integration of research and education in this activity. Furthermore, the participants will be able to interact with the tutorial speakers and with other students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The Machine Learning Summer School is designed to enable participants with different backgrounds to gain in-depth knowledge of the current state of the art in machine learning. The participants will interact with leading machine learning experts from academia and industry. It contributes to the creation of a diverse cadre of machine learning researchers and practitioners by offering unique training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from under-represented groups through personalized mentoring and scholarships.</AbstractNarration>
