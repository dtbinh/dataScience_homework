    <AbstractNarration>Loline alkaloids are made by the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium sp. as part of a symbiotic relationship to keep insect herbivores from consuming their tall fescue host. Previous research has indicated that some epiphytic bacterial colonizers of tall fescue can use these alkaloids as a sole carbon source. Such bacteria grow to higher population sizes on loline containing grasses than other bacterial strains. It is thought that a multi-trophic symbiosis is occurring on the grass phyllosphere between the loline catabolizing bacteria, the host, and the endophytic fungus. This project will test the potential positive impact of loline catabolizing bacterial epiphytes on growth of the host. The bacteria will be screened for production of the plant growth regulators, auxin and cytokinin, through growth assays, microscopy, and biochemistry. Additionally, the protective impacts of loline catabolizing bacteria on the host grasses will be investigated by screening them for the antimicrobial production. The ability of the bacteria to protect their hosts via niche exclusion will also be examined. A combination of culturing and biochemistry techniques will be conducted for these tests. Finally, the potential to take advantage of the affinity of loline catabolizing strains to Neotyphodium sp. harboring grasses for the bioremediation of the major pollutant Atrazine will be tested. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data collected from this work will have broad implications on the current scientific knowledge concerning microbe:microbe interactions. Potentially, this work may result in an efficient way to remove atrazine from the environment, which would generate safer ground water for future generations.</AbstractNarration>
