    <AbstractNarration>The Brigham Young (BYU) Site of the I/UCRC for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC) seeks to continue its momentum from its initial phase of operation through a Phase II award. Reconfigurable computing, promises to realize performance potential of underlying hardware system resources in a highly adaptive manner, maximizing performance while minimizing implementation challenges such as system size, weight, cost, and power. Areas of research thrust for the next phase of the BYU CHREC site include: reliable reconfigurable computing, design automation and programming methods; algorithms and applications; and systems and services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leadership in reconfigurable hardware and system platforms represents a critical area for national competitiveness of every growing cyber-enabled economy. Working with its Industrial Advisory Board, the BYU site of CHREC center along with the center as a whole intends to serve as a catalyst that brings leading organizations together to define common goals, methods, and standards. Research results are planned to be integrated into the university educational process with expanded programs at multiple levels in engineering. Activities are planned to be structured to attract a diverse set of students and faculty, including underrepresented students via several minority recruitment programs.</AbstractNarration>
