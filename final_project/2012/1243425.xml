    <AbstractNarration>The proposed study focuses on the commercialization of predictive technology for failure prevention of industrial machinery. The commercialization of this technology has the potential to represent a significant development that will be leveraging years of scientific and engineering research in the area of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). The enhanced reconfigurable and modularized software platform is an important step for achieving the goal of rapid and low-cost solutions for predicting and preventing failures in industrial machinery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope of the proposed effort during the I-Corps study addresses a significant need expressed by industry for having a commercialized solution for predictive maintenance. The successful demonstration during previous projects showed the feasibility of the technology. However, in order to demonstrate the full economic benefits regarding cost, asset availability, and downtime reduction that industry desires, the technology must be cast in a form that can be more easily deployed and implemented. Successful implementation of this technology in manufacturing facilities has the potential to result in lower cost and higher quality products, thus providing a benefit to the end users of the manufactured goods. In addition, manufactures who implement this technology will likely have a competitive advantage in the market place due to the higher quality and productivity they could achieve by preventing costly equipment failures.</AbstractNarration>
