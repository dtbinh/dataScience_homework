    <AbstractNarration>Whole genome sequence information has transformed research in traditional model organisms, and now next-generation sequencing technology is at a turning point in its application to non-model organisms. Researchers working in data-rich, but sequence-poor, organismal systems are eager to apply these technologies to their own species. However, the challenges involved in generating useful, high quality, whole genome sequences in these naive systems are substantial. Non-model systems can have many biological features that directly hamper genome assembly, and therefore suffer from limited capacity to benefit from genomic tools. This research aims to develop a new approach to genome assembly, one that combines next-generation sequencing with recombinant populations made using genetic crosses between individuals. If the full potential of the method can be demonstrated, it will bring the power of genome-enabled science within reach of a large range of non-model organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tremendous amount of biological knowledge lies hidden within the genetic make-up of every organism on earth. The secrets of these organisms potentially hold the keys to understanding the origins of biodiversity and the answers to many other biological puzzles. This research will provide new tools that can be used to unlock the genetic information contained within any species. The methods developed will therefore be of great benefit to a large number of researchers.</AbstractNarration>
