    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the creation of a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of South Carolina. This site will provide a 10-week summer research experience for 8 participants. The REU site will leverage the expertise of the USC Physics and Astronomy faculty in areas of nuclear and particle physics, nanotechnology, and theoretical/computational modeling to advance the understanding of the fundamental physical interactions that govern the structure and substance of matter on microscopic and microscopic scales. In addition to research, participants will engage in weekly educational activities, which will teach research strategies, ethics, and career strategies. Planned social activities will build a sense of community among mentors and participants. The summer will conclude with a symposium, during which participants will present their research findings in both a poster and an oral presentation. The presentation materials are designed such that participants will leave the program with the materials necessary to present their research at national and regional meetings.</AbstractNarration>
