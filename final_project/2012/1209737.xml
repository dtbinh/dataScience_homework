    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Anthony Barthel of Pennsylvania State University to conduct a research project, entitled "Nano-scale surface texturing effects on friction of silver-carbon nanotube composite coatings," during the summer of 2012 at Yonsei Univeristy in Seoul, South Korea. The host scientist is Prof. Dae-Eun Kim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to better understand the impact of surface texturing on a wear reducing coating. This research promises to broaden knowledge of lubricating methods for nano-scale devices necessary for operable microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
