    <AbstractNarration>This proposal focuses on developing methods to automate the time-consuming process of selecting good overview and review articles from on-line new sources. The goal is to select articles understandable by persons outside the field and use them on the AITopics information portal maintained by the AAAI. The AITopics website is a widely used authoritative source about Artificial Intelligence that is used by a wide variety of people seeking information about AI: novices, students, the press, etc. AITopics is intended to provide explanatory, accessible material about multiple subtopics that make up the field of AI. This project will develop new methods for this finding/filtering such articles and build on methods already used by AITopics. The resulting software will be open-source and is intended in the long run to be applicable to other scientific discipline beyond AI, particularly by their professional societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will pursue two thrusts to generalize the current NewsFinder program, which was developed as a part of AITopics and currently finds many types of news stories about AI. The first thrust of this project is to enable it to find overview and review articles automatically. The second thrust is to enable the program to learn from data collected from readers and administrators.</AbstractNarration>
