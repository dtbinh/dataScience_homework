    <AbstractNarration>THhis RAPID requestaims to collect a new and exciting data set that will support geyser eruption&lt;br/&gt;research currently funded by the National Science Foundation. The goal of this proposal&lt;br/&gt;is to create a short-term seismic array that will monitor and characterize the seismic&lt;br/&gt;behavior of the shall subsurface at El Tatio Geyser Fields. This is the third largest&lt;br/&gt;geyser field in the world. Due to the more relaxed stance on marginally invasive&lt;br/&gt;scientific investigations, El Tatio is an ideal location to deploy such a network. The data&lt;br/&gt;will be unique in sensor density and duration. Consequently, results will likely surpass&lt;br/&gt;those for any other geyser field. The goal is to characterize subsurface processes resulting in seismic vibrations and&lt;br/&gt;correlate these sources with surface eruption characteristics measured by Michael&lt;br/&gt;Manga?s group (at UC Berkeley). The concurrent measurements of temperature,&lt;br/&gt;discharge rate, eruption height, eruption duration and recurrence time, will make this data&lt;br/&gt;set completely unique. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the world?s third largest geyser field, El Tatio is a key geotourism location. Better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the subsurface processes for such locations will eventually help&lt;br/&gt;education the broader public. Geyser eruptions are also key for understanding volcanic&lt;br/&gt;eruption processes as well as constraining important properties for geothermal energy&lt;br/&gt;generation. Because this is a unique data set, and the data will be archived at the IRIS&lt;br/&gt;DMC for posterity, we anticipate that the data will contribute to further investigations&lt;br/&gt;into geothermal and geyser processes.</AbstractNarration>
