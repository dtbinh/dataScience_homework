    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to use a structured hypothesis-validation approach to identify and mitigate multiple knowledge gaps in technology transition of the natural fiber reinforced composites, including value proposition; customer/user-case; demand creation; channel development; revenue model; partnership strategy; and resource development. Scientific advances for this research include 1) the systematic study of processing structural- property relationship of high performance natural fiber reinforced composites; 2) the transformative investigation of high performance natural fiber composites processing mechanism in production scale for structural applications. The combination of forefront material synthesis methods with advanced characterization and testing technology could provide a foundation for both understanding and processing of natural fiber reinforced composites with excellent mechanical and structural properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new class of natural fiber reinforced composites with robust mechanical properties could play a significant role in addressing current energy and sustainability challenges. With excellent mechanical properties, these bio-based composites could provide a sustainable solution to replace chemically treated wood and petroleum based (fiberglass) composites in many applications, such as civil infrastructure constructions; building panels and automobile parts. If successful, this program may result in technology transition of natural fiber reinforced composites, and increase economic and workforce development in the nation.</AbstractNarration>
