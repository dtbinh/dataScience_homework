    <AbstractNarration>Active Learning Strategies for Algebra-based Introductory Physics at UCF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Physics at the University of Central Florida proposes to implement a two-pronged activity-based curriculum in its introductory algebra-based physics courses, and contrast these two interactive pedagogies with more traditional physics lecture and lab learning. The first, already initiated, is known as full-studio (FS), and is based on the Beichner's notably successful SCALE-UP approach, a marked shift from the traditional physics lecture and laboratory setting to a single collaborative physics workspace rich with technological and experimental tools, and shown to be particularly effective in achieving student learning gains in conceptual physics without sacrificing problem-solving skills. The second, more novel and less abrupt transition from traditional lecture/lab format, goes by the name "ministudios with lectures" (MSL)---self-contained physics content modules which emphasize problem-solving, collaborative group work, experimental physics, and conceptual learning, and will be coordinated with technologically enhanced lectures. MSL will be compared to both the FS and traditional approaches with regard to student learning gains, ease of faculty adoption, cost, and distinctiveness from the calculus-based physics sequence, which has seen considerably more study than the algebra-based sequence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UCF is one of the largest universities in the country, with a diverse student body numbering well over 50,000, and teaching more physics credit hours than most any other US physics department, thus providing an excellent testing ground for these proposed improvements. Additional features of the pedagogical model include Peer Instruction with "clicker" questions, Interactive Lecture Demonstrations, and additional instructional support from Graduate Teaching Assistants and Undergraduate Learning Assistants, who receive regular training in active learning techniques.</AbstractNarration>
