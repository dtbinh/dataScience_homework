    <AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the Advanced Research Workshop on Future Trends in Microelectronics, which is to be held in Corsica, France during June 25-29, 2012, is to discuss the future of the rapidly evolving microelectronics technology, in a small group, with leaders in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;The Workshop will provide a forum for an exchange of views among leading research professionals in industry, academia, and government. The intent is to arrive at a far-reaching overview of the evolution of microelectronics in the coming decade or more, as perceived by leading practitioners in the field. The major goal of the workshop is to assess the current status, define future research directions in microelectronics and to establish collaborations between researchers. This will be achieved through presentations and open discussions of the key technical issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: &lt;br/&gt;It is expected that this Workshop will be instrumental in defining the research required by the growing demands of microelectronics in the coming decade. This workshop will also contribute to the training of participating students and the topics will be disseminated through the Conference Technical Digest.</AbstractNarration>
