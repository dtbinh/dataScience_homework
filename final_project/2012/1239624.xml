    <AbstractNarration>The 34th Midwest Probability Colloquium at Northwestern University on October 12-14, 2012, at Northwestern University. Probability theory has been the most applicable branch of pure mathematics. During the last decade we have seen a clear surge in popularity of probabilistic tools and methods in other branches of pure and applied mathematics. This year's selection of program topics and speakers reflect the broad scope of applicability of the discipline. By maintaining a wide range of active research directions, the Midwest Probability Colloquium continues to provide a forum for the exchange of intellectual interest across a wide array of applied fields as well as for core areas of mathematics. Following the well established traditional format, the colloquium will be divided into the Tutorial Program and the Research Program. This year's topic of the Tutorial Program is Probability and Mathematical Biology and will be hosted by&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Steven Evans (University of California, Berkeley)&lt;br/&gt;David Steinsaltz (University of Oxford)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The speakers of the Research Program are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elizabeth Meckes (CaseWestern Research University)&lt;br/&gt;Jeremy Quastel (University of Toronto)&lt;br/&gt;Gennady Samorodnitsky (Cornell University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will be sponsored jointly by the National Science Foundation with a conference grant and by Northwestern University with providing the venue and other local amenities.</AbstractNarration>
