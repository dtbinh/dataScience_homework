    <AbstractNarration>The Collaborative for Enhancing Diversity in the Sciences (CEDS) proposes to host a workshop of university and college representatives, social science research methodology experts, and STEM disciplinary stakeholders to examine data collection and associated research methodology and reporting standards to advance the STEM stakeholders' power to more effectively deal with demographic discrepancies in STEM. This request is to support a workshop to establish a common standard for measuring and evaluating success of diversity-enhancing programs. The one-day workshop will include stakeholders from universities and colleges, professional societies and associations as well as local, regional and national federal and private organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is well-recognized in the scientific community that data-driven, scientifically rigorous tools are needed to stimulate and enhance efforts to use the talents of all our citizens, including underrepresented minorities and women. There is an additional need to look beyond individual efforts to begin to pursue a system-based analysis. This workshop will address the need to establish a more comprehensive and cohesive effort to track the many and various efforts of government (federal, state, and local), private foundations, universities and colleges, scientific societies, and professional associations. Systematic data collection would allow possible answers to broad and important questions such as: To what extent should research training be supported collaboratively? What are the best practices that could be adapted that would allow for a maximum increase on the return on investment?</AbstractNarration>
