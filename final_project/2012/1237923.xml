    <AbstractNarration>High-level managed languages, such as Java, provide strong semantic guarantees, but these guarantees are only as good as the underlying software stack. The research funded by this EAGER award will address the problem of verifying the compiler and runtime systems of managed languages and address the interplay between the formal verification of the underlying software stack and the memory models used by these languages&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The correctness of safety-critical code is very important, but also very difficult to guarantee. Existing practice relies on manual code reviews and testing to ensure correctness, which are methods that do not provide strong guarantees. This research has the potential to improve the safety and robustness of managed-language implementations. These implementations, in turn, will improve the reliability of safety-critical software that runs on them.</AbstractNarration>
