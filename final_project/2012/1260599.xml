    <AbstractNarration>MB-System is an open source software package that enables the user to manipulate, process, display, and analyze swath sonar bathymetry and sidescan data. Renewal of support for MB-System allows upgrades that take advantage of recent hardware improvements including: addition of new data formats; uses beyond standard seafloor mapping (e.g. water column mapping), evolving computer architecture which, with the planned upgrades, will lead to increased program performance. Outputs for new real-time data display capability will be added for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In contrast to when MB-System was first developed, there are now commercial software packages available to process swath sonar data. However, Geoscience researchers continue to require capabilities that are not available elsewhere- multiple survey handling, access to and ability to adjust filtering parameters- as well as needing a low cost method to conduct this type of work. Scientists can share in the development of MB-System modules and this provides a vibrant exchange of information and keeps the package well-tuned to user needs.</AbstractNarration>
