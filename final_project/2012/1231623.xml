    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The objective of this research is to conduct longitudinal investigations of the relationship between spatial skills and mathematics achievement in girls from families from a range of income and educational levels. One type of spatial skill, 3-d mental rotation ability, shows the largest gender differences favoring boys of any other cognitive measure, with girls using less effective strategies than boys solving these problems. For girls, in particular, this type of spatial reasoning has been found to be a strong predictor of mathematics achievement. By focusing on variability among girls from a longitudinal perspective, the purpose of the present study is to provide a nuanced account of developmental mechanisms that may promote girls' spatial and mathematics skills. The project includes two studies of the acquisition of spatial and mathematics skills in girls over time. Study 1 addresses longitudinal changes among girls in the relation between 3-d mental rotation skills and mathematics achievement from fifth through seventh grade (the period in which 3-d spatial skills are being acquired in girls). This longitudinal research will allow for more causal inferences about the links between spatial skills and mathematics achievement over this time period. Study 2 addresses the influence of girls' early skills and early mathematics experiences in the home, on their later mathematics achievement and spatial skills. This study is a follow-up of a NSF-funded study of first grade girls, in which the same sample will be assessed at fifth grade. The previous study showed that early home mathematics experiences were important predictors of mathematics achievement in first-grade girls, and mediated the association between socio-economic status and mathematics performance. This study will investigate whether these early mathematics experiences in girls have any long-term impact on their later mathematics achievement in fifth grade, when controlling for SES levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: A careful analysis of girls' developmental changes in the relationship between spatial and mathematics skills over time will provide much needed information about the critical role that spatial ability plays in girls' STEM success and educational and occupational choices and outcomes. This may provide important educational clues on how to more effectively teach girls to develop their spatial reasoning skills and to apply them when approaching mathematics problems with the overarching goal being to broaden the participation of girls in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
