    <AbstractNarration>Recent studies involving electron-flavor neutrinos have raised many interesting questions. For example, is there electron-neutrino appearance at short baseline? What is the magnitude of the missing mixing matrix parameter, associated with the electron-flavor? And is there CP violation in the light neutrino sector, which is explored through electron-neutrino appearance? These questions are identified as top priority in advancing knowledge within the neutrino physics field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for students and postdocs on a series of neutrino experiments chosen to be phased in time: MiniBooNE, SciBooNE, Double Chooz, MicroBooNE and DAEDALUS. These experiments are selected to have intellectual coherence and to allow the students and postdocs in the group to experience all stages of experimental work within their careers at MIT. MIT has a central role in the MiniBooNE oscillation analysis and in developing associated phenomenological models involving sterile neutrinos. The MiniBooNE results have excited interest in next generation short-baseline experiments, including the MicroBooNE experiment that will address the MiniBooNE event excesses with state-of-the-art liquid argon technology. MIT is responsible for delivering the light collection system on MicroBooNE and for R&amp;D on the first lightguide-based detection system for future large LAr detectors. The group plays a leading role in the US-based analysis of the last neutrino mixing angle from the Double Chooz data. MIT has specialized in monitoring on Double Chooz and this award provides support for a novel directional neutron monitor, DCTPC, which will be constructed in this grant period. DAEDALUS, with its multiple beams and single detector, is an example of how the MIT group develops transformative ideas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The PI is dedicated to expanding participation of women and minorities in STEM, as well as improving STEM education and teacher development. The group is involved in numerous projects to increase public scientific literacy and gives many public talks, communicating the excitement of neutrino physics.</AbstractNarration>
