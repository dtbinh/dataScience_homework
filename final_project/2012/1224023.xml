    <AbstractNarration>This award will partially support a workshop to help organize paleoclimate modelers and data generators for participation in the IPCC AR5 deliberations. Specifically, the award will be used to support the travel costs for six early career researchers and graduate students to participate in the workshop as well as provide some support for meals during the meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the first time, paleoclimate modeling/data research activities are being incorporated into the Coupled Modeling Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) activities. A major goal of the workshop is to ensure that the community of paleoclimate researchers is aware of the best practices to be applied in these modeling/data comparison activities. The outcome of the workshop should be better approaches for using paleoclimate model/data activities to infer climate sensitivities to external forcings and strategies to account for uncertainties in both the model output and paleoclimate proxy reconstructions.</AbstractNarration>
