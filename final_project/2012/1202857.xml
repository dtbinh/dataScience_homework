    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to develop a cost effective, robust, reproducible, stable SERS (Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy) substrate with high spatial resolution for ultra-sensitive biodiagnostics. SERS is a powerful, versatile bioscreening technique based on molecular vibrations that currently lacks a tunable, homogenous, repeatable, inexpensive and sensitive substrate of uniform geometry. The central focus of this research is to address the existing SERS challenge through the development of a robust, mass manufacturable, ultra dense, reproducible ordered array of ion implantation seeded silica nanowires of well defined geometry as an effective SERS substrate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objectives of the proposal are to (a) investigate and study the growth kinetics of ion-implantation seeded selective nucleation of silica nanowires, (b) synthesize ultra-dense massively parallel array of vertically aligned wires of controlled geometry, (c) develop and apply robust, dynamic nanomanufacturing schemes to achieve reliable and reproducible fabrication of these batch fabricated nanowires, (d) validate the spatially confined SERS substrate for active bioscreening by real-time detection of the desired species and (e) develop a strong interdisciplinary, laboratory-based research, education and outreach program focusing on integration of biology, nanomanufacturing, and microsystems that will have an impact on the training of middle school, high school, community college students and teaching fraternity from all backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research opens the gateway for using ion implantation as a general purpose nanoscale catalysis tool towards mass manufacturing bottom-up controlled nanosystems for wide variety of applications. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Advancements in the field of nanoscale science, tools and techniques with emphasis on emerging disciplines like nanomanufacturing would be widely disseminated through the innovative "K- PhD" program. Moreover, the research has participation of the underrepresented groups (minority, women) and fosters partnerships through ongoing international collaboration and exchange. The results of the research will translate into case studies in course modules and seminars/presentations rendered by the investigators.</AbstractNarration>
