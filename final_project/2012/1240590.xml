    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This project takes advantage of the latest development in X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) at the Linac Coherent Lisht Source (LCLS) to structurally characterize intact photosynthetic organelles, chlorosomes and carboxysomes. The research undertaking embodies high-risk, high reward research since every experiment undertaken at the LCLS is at the frontier of imaging biology which continues to be under development. Chlorosomes and carboxysomes have not yet been subjected to these methods. Both types of complexes provide unprecedented test cases for XFELs diffraction in that they can both be treated as single particle experiments but with crystalline components. Particles of this size and complexity have not yet been characterized. This is a high risk project in that it is difficult to anticipate the characteristics of the resulting data from these "diffract and destroy" experiments. Methods for processing and analyzing these data will be developed. The results of the project will lay the foundation for visualization of functioning macromolecular organelles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project is associated with the training of young scientists at arguably the most exciting intersection of math, physics and biology in a large (9 groups) international collaboration. The pioneering methods developed will be useful for advancing the community of researchers gaining access to LCLS beam-time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Biomolecular Dynamics Structure and Function Cluster and the Networks and Regulation Cluster.</AbstractNarration>
