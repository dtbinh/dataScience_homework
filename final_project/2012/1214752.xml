    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of developing a next-generation neurological training tool for medical schools and teaching hospitals. Traditional medical school teaching has relied on a period of book learning, followed by an apprenticeship with graded responsibility in performing procedures. The desire to reduce health care costs and improve patient safety has created a need for better training tools. The Neurosyntec cerebrospinal physiology trainer is a realistic rendition of the cerebrospinal axis that combines both virtual and physical elements for an unprecedented level of simulation realism and user interactivity. This Phase I will produce a prototype of this robotic trainer for testing at local medical schools and hospitals. This work will guide further development toward commercialization in this growing niche area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a safe and cost-effective training platform that facilitates the development of the cognitive and psychomotor skills necessary for neurological diagnosis and treatment. The technology will also allow the development of new and more efficient ways of standardizing assessment and certification of practitioners, which will be of benefit to society. Finally, company hopes to stimulate local economic growth through job creation.</AbstractNarration>
