    <AbstractNarration>This project supports a workshop entitled `` DATA-DRIVEN ENERGY SYSTEMS: From Data Collection to Information Technology for Sustainable Services?? to be held at Carnegie Mellon University on March 12-14, 2012. It is a part of the 8th Carnegie Mellon University Electricity Conference that provides a venue for structured brainstorming by the thought leaders in multiple communities. One of the key premises in this workshop is that IT-enabled flexible utilization of assets is key to sustainable energy services. However, the challenge is enormous as the industry paradigm shifts from the predictive, worst-case centralized data management to highly distributed interactive data and resource management. Invited talks by the academic, industry and government participants will be presented to pose these problems more formally, to assess state-of-the-art, and to investigate new approaches. The conference proceedings will provide a point of reference for future research and education.</AbstractNarration>
