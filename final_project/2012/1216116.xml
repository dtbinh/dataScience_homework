    <AbstractNarration>The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network is conducting two workshops to provide technical assistance to minority-serving institutions (MSIs) to increase their participation and competitiveness in NSF's Math and Science Partnership (MSP) program. The technical assistance will be in the form of annual two-day workshops to assist three-person teams from MSIs in further developing their ideas for MSP proposals for the FY 2012 and FY 2013 MSP competitions. Each institutional team will consist of a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) faculty member, an education faculty member, and a representative from a local/regional school district. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSIs), and Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) with accredited teacher education programs will be specifically targeted. Following each workshop, the workshop agenda, with links to workshop presentations, are posted at QEM's website. Also posted are selected abstracts of currently funded MSP projects that focus on predominantly minority school districts, so that other interested groups can benefit.</AbstractNarration>
