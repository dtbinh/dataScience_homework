    <AbstractNarration>This award to Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) is for the acquisition of a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) capability. This instrument will support nanotechnology research and training at the Integrated Nanosystems Development Institute (INDI) of IUPUI, while stimulating collaborations across campus and with regional industrial partners. The enhanced nanometer scale imaging resolution and elemental analysis capabilities will significantly enhance a large number of ongoing projects, including: (1) Energy: Battery, fuel cells, solar cells, and energy storage; (2) Investigation of fundamental forces at the submicron scale; (3) Sensors and materials development for environmental and biomedical applications; and, (4) Molecular and cellular roles in biological systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FESEM will provide undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-docs with valuable hands-on experience in operating state-of-the-art instrumentation, an essential skill for students interested in future graduate studies and careers in STEM fields. Moreover, the instrument's impact on women and minorities will be substantial, as 50% of IUPUI graduates are women and 16% are from underrepresented groups. In addition, faculty researchers within INDI actively recruit undergraduates from historically black colleges and universities to participate in summer research opportunities. Planned educational efforts include teaching FESEM theory and practice in three nanotechnology-based courses and an electron microscopy course, which attracts both undergraduate and graduate students from multiple disciplines. The instrument will also be used to strengthen planned community outreach activities, including existing nanotechnology discovery summer camps for K-12 students and teachers, where this instrument will allow the exploration of nanoscale materials and structures, and better understanding of nanotechnology concepts.</AbstractNarration>
