    <AbstractNarration>The University of Oregon is awarded a grant to expand and modernize aging components of the running seawater system at the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (http://pages.uoregon.edu/oimb/). The system, which is used daily by virtually all researchers and students at the facility including scientists from other institutions, is the most important part of the marine lab infrastructure. Large seawater pumps near the end of their useful life will be replaced with new pumps controlled by a microprocessor-based system that can be monitored and programmed through a secure wireless network. The pumps and controls will be contained in a new pump house that affords excellent protection from salt spray and humidity. A backup generator will assure continuous operation during power outages and wasteful freshwater priming will be replaced with a simple and sustainable seawater priming system. New storage tanks will increase capacity to accommodate the growing numbers of visitors and students that use the marine lab. This infrastructure improvement will support research in developmental biology, larval biology, animal behavior and ecology, all of which require reliably pure and abundant seawater. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seawater system is integral to virtually all of the marine education at the University of Oregon, including programs directed at elementary school classes and teachers, undergraduate college students, visiting classes from other colleges, community college faculty and students, and visiting graduate students. The general public is served by lectures and workshops as well as a new public museum and aquarium that will soon open. Several programs at the University of Oregon are directed at minority students, including Native Americans. A Coastal Master Naturalist certification program prepares informal marine science educators for service in state parks and other venues. Marine science curriculum developed for teachers is made freely available on the internet.</AbstractNarration>
