    <AbstractNarration>1254484&lt;br/&gt;Huang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cell properties have been extensively examined in two-dimensions (2D), yielding fruitful information&lt;br/&gt;regarding focal adhesions, migration, the establishment of polarity, traction forces and&lt;br/&gt;mechanotransductive responses. However, with few exceptions, most cells in vivo exist in a threedimensional&lt;br/&gt;(3D) environment, where their behavior is considerably different compared to when they are&lt;br/&gt;plated on a petri dish. Not only are there significant geometric differences, but there are also&lt;br/&gt;omnidirectional cell-cell interactions as well as cell-matrix interactions. As disease and tissue engineering&lt;br/&gt;research advance, it is imperative that cellular behavior and properties are established in detail. However,&lt;br/&gt;achieving this goal has been slow, in a large part because imaging and otherwise probing cells embedded&lt;br/&gt;within other cells and/or matrices is difficult due to scattering and inaccessibility. Thus there is a need for&lt;br/&gt;transforming techniques to derive information from three-dimensional cellular constructs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific objectives of this proposal are (1) to design and implement a microrheometer to&lt;br/&gt;characterize cellular properties that can remove out-of-plane noise and perform three-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;tracking, (2) to use the microrheometer to assess changes in cell rheological properties under resting&lt;br/&gt;conditions as well as under mechanical stimuli, in a variety of 2D and 3D environments, and (3) to model&lt;br/&gt;2D and 3D rheological changes using a novel 9-parameter computational model based on a Monte Carlo&lt;br/&gt;simulation which will be used to interpret the results from the experimental parts of the project.&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary work demonstrates that cell behavior in layered 2D arrangements are already more&lt;br/&gt;complex than simple 2D plating can predict. These results further demonstrate the effectiveness of new&lt;br/&gt;techniques for acquiring microrheological measurements in a variety of conditions. The next logical step&lt;br/&gt;is to deploy more advanced techniques to 3D, and to carefully examine cell behavior and response in&lt;br/&gt;more realistic environments, and to create computational models to help interpret the results. Thus, this&lt;br/&gt;project will provide the groundwork for years of research in basic cell biomechanics, tissue engineering,&lt;br/&gt;as well as imaging techniques that may rely on these measurements for diagnoses or treatments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The driving goal of this project is to characterize cells in threedimensional&lt;br/&gt;environments by designing advanced imaging setups, coupled with computational&lt;br/&gt;models to help interpret the results. Because 3D is the next major area of cell-based research, and&lt;br/&gt;because tools for examining biomechanics and mechanotransduction are currently lacking for 3D&lt;br/&gt;experimentation, the work proposed here will help advance the field of biomechanics, tissue engineering&lt;br/&gt;and imaging. Ultimately, a vastly improved and more realistic model of cell behavior in vivo will be&lt;br/&gt;established and better models of cell regulation and physiology can be created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall merit of this work lies in the ability to precisely characterize cell properties under&lt;br/&gt;realistic but controlled conditions, where one can vary the extracellular matrix constituents, the&lt;br/&gt;mechanical stresses acting on the cells, and the degree of cell-cell interactions. Thus, these results can be&lt;br/&gt;transformative for the field of cell mechanics and mechanotransduction, which themselves are relevant for&lt;br/&gt;a broad range of other fields. Because of the fast development of 3D tissue-engineered constructs and the&lt;br/&gt;need for characterizing cell properties, this proposal seeks to fill a large gap in current knowledge. For&lt;br/&gt;example, is it true that in response to mechanical stimuli, cells first fluidize their interior to permit&lt;br/&gt;remodeling? Do cells plated in 3D exhibit different anisotropy from cells plated in 2D? Does altering the&lt;br/&gt;adhesive ligand engaged by one layer of cells affect a second layer of cells plated on top of the first layer?&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to answer these, and other, questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Because of the breadth of this project, there is considerable opportunity for&lt;br/&gt;having broader impacts on many aspects of biomedical engineering education and outreach. Because&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of contemporary biomedical engineering techniques and stem cell biology are not yet widely&lt;br/&gt;available to educational programs and the public at large, part of this project is dedicated to outreach.&lt;br/&gt;This outreach program is based on expanding a remote lab program by creating freely available videos&lt;br/&gt;along the line of the "Minute Physics" videos, but with a focus on biomedical engineering topics and&lt;br/&gt;techniques, posted to YouTube and other high-traffic video sites. Additionally, a broader selection of&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students will be provided the opportunities to engage in laboratory research. Finally,&lt;br/&gt;courses in tissue and molecular engineering and biomechanics will be enhanced by the topics explored in&lt;br/&gt;this proposal, with plans for supplementary material stemming from a textbook that is currently in press.</AbstractNarration>
