    <AbstractNarration>1256304 &lt;br/&gt;Lenhoff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial travel support for young researchers to attend the 17th biannual International Conference on Biopartitioning and Purification (BPP 2013), which will be held in Newport, RI, October 6-10, 2013. Award funds will be used primarily to subsidize the travel and registration fees for US students to attend the conference; similar subsidies may also be made available to US junior faculty attending the conference. The scientific scope of the conference will include areas such as thermodynamics of phase formation and the partitioning of biological, molecular aspects of interactions between biologicals and media, multi-mode chromatographic processes, high titer processes, affinity-enhanced bioseparations, purification unit operation modeling and optimization, rational/high-throughput bioprocess design, particle/virus-like particle purification, DNA/RNA purification, and emerging bioseparation technologies. The goal is to define the topical areas as inclusively as possible so as to attract a wide variety of relevant submissions, select those of highest quality for inclusion in the program, and then to organize the oral presentations into cohesive topical sessions. A number of invited keynote lectures by internationally recognized leaders from both industry and academia will be invited. Information on the conference will be made available primarily via the conference website, which is being modeled on that used for BPP 2011 (www.bpp2011.org). The organizers will seek publication of research presented at the conference in a dedicated issue of a leading journal. BPP 2013 represents an outstanding opportunity for students to obtain a distinctive perspective over bioseparations and bioprocessing more generally in an integrated context that is not limited to an individual unit operation.</AbstractNarration>
