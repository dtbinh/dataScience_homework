    <AbstractNarration>This award, to be supported by the Office of International Sciences and Engineering (OISE), will enable the participation of U.S. academic oceanographers in a program development workshop between the US and Chile. The central goal of this workshop is to bring together individuals for the US and Chile who are experts on oceanographic research in the eastern South Pacific. It is expected that this workshop will facilitate interactions between Chilean scientists from academia, the Chilean Navy Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (SHOA), and the National Oceanographic Committee, and US scientists from the Naval Research Laboratory, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of intellectual merit, the workshop will be provide an opportunity for coordination and collaboration between U.S. and Chilean scientists that are interested in oceanographic research aboard the new Chilean vessel, the Cabo de Hornos. In addition, as U.S. scientists often coordinate with Chilean scientists on ocean cruise activities in the Southern Ocean, Eastern Pacific, and Triple Junction areas, this workshop will enable interested stakeholders to meet face to face to set future priorities in science, logistics and ship facilities.</AbstractNarration>
