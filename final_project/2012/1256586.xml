    <AbstractNarration>This EAGER WIDER project, Championing Educational Change through Assessment for the Next Generation of Engineers' Success (CHANGES), is engaged in a comprehensive evaluation of the extent of implementation of evidence-based instructional practices and the factors that influence them in the Fulton Engineering Schools at Arizona State University (ASU). A web-enabled assessment framework and other processes are being utilized to generate information that will inform planning and provide input data for a project that will focus on facilitating systemic change. A major emphasis is on courses and faculty teaching them for lower division students. The primary focus is on core engineering, and general education and foundational courses in mathematics, chemistry and physics. Remaining engineering faculty are being included along with an upper division course they teach. The interactions among and between faculty in the project are intended to initiate a dialogue about reform and could act as a catalyst and a way increasing buy-in for systemic change. The data, evaluation, and recommendations from this project will be used to plan for reform.</AbstractNarration>
