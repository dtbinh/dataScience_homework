    <AbstractNarration>This awarad provides student travel support for the (Association for Computing Machinery) ACM International Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems held in Toronto, Canada, on November 6-9, 2012. The conference is a cross disciplinary forum for research on systems issues in embedded and networked sensors. The award allows a selected set of twenty five United States students interested in research in embedded and networked sensors to travel to this conference and benefit from talks and other events. To ensure greater participation and to provide equal opportunity for all interested students to apply for travel funds, the Student Travel Grant opportunity will be advertised in newsgroups, emails lists and the conference web page. The selection for the Student Travel Grants, to be done by the conference Student Travel Award Chair, will be in accordance with the following: the applicant must be a current student at a recognized United States institution of higher education; the applicant?fs field of study must be related to the topics of the conference. Priority will be given to female and under?]represented minority students, students pursuing their graduate studies in Minority Serving Institutions, such as, Historically Black Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and institutions that serve Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and persons with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bringing students together with experienced practitioners enriches existing research projects and creates new collaborations. The opportunity to attend the top conference in embedded and networked sensor systems can have a long lasting effect on students in their early careers, motivating them to perform excellent research, publish in top avenues and become productive members of our society.</AbstractNarration>
