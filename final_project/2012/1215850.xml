    <AbstractNarration>Maintaining the health and well-being of the aging US presents significant challenges. The workshop brings together leaders in geriatric and biomedical research, government, telecommunications, home monitoring companies, pharmaceutical companies, and non-profit advocacy groups to identify strategies that will support a national network of home-based monitoring and assessment capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: The workshop will identify research challenges and opportunities relating to identification, monitoring, and analysis of activities across multiple time scales, locations, specific actions, functional abilities and physiological changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will focus on research challenges in creating a scalable infrastructure and technology for large scale distributed longiitudinal studies that help answer many unanswered questions regarding aging and independent living through coordinated gathering and analysis of behavioral, social, biological, clinical, genetic, economic, and environmental data. The workshop is expected to produce a report, giving concrete examples of what is needed to progress, from a technical standpoint and from a funding perspective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: If successful, the workshop would help identify the research challenges and opportunities in creating the infrastructure and research networks needed to advance the understanding of aging and to develop technologies that better support the health and wellbeing of the aging population in the US.</AbstractNarration>
