    <AbstractNarration>The Students in Engineering Technology (SET) project is addressing employer's needs by producing highly skilled and educated technicians who are prepared to enter and succeed in the field of Engineering Technology (ET). The SET project partners include Leon County Schools, Wakulla County Schools, Daytona State College, Florida State University College of Engineering, FLATE, and regional employers. The project is developing a career pathway in ET in manufacturing that leads to a diverse population of students entering the program at different stages. Entry points include high school dual-enrollment, the community college, 4-year institutions and incumbent workers through co-operative education programs. The project is providing multiple exit points to support student educational career needs that include credit certificate programs, associate degrees or baccalaureate degrees. The SET project is stimulating learning by offering educational opportunities that far exceed current curriculum options. By providing concentrations in a variety of technical areas as well as an emphasis on contextual, practical training and education methods, this project is encouraging the study of ET in manufacturing with the outcome as either a technician in industry or continued progression into a four-year ET program. This project is broadening the participation of underrepresented groups by an aggressive high school campus presence with mentoring and advising of students and parents. Further, summer bridge courses and technology camps are providing continuity in the education process, a valuable marketing tool to attract future students for program sustainability and intensive practical experience for all student participants.</AbstractNarration>
