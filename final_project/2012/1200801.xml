    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in the Wabash Seminar and associated annual Miniconferences during the period 2012-2014. The Wabash Seminar will meet four times each year at the Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, two in spring and two in fall. The associated Miniconference will be held each fall at the IUPUI campus in Indianapolis. The Wabash Seminar and Miniconferences bring together both experienced and junior researchers, including graduate students, and postdocs to discuss recent work and advances in analysis. The meetings take advantage of the presence of strong groups of operator algebraists and operator theorists in the Midwest region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wabash seminar series offers an excellent opportunity for junior researchers and graduate students to be exposed to, and informed about, the latest major mathematical developments in Modern Analysis. This exposure often serves to develop their mathematical taste and to influence very beneficially the future directions of their research. The seminar has also helped develop collaborative efforts between the specialists invited to address it and researchers in this geographical area. Scientifically, there is potential for advances in operator algebras and operator theory and their related disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
