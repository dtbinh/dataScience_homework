    <AbstractNarration>MRI funds will be used to acquire a Lachat Instruments QuikChemÂ® 8500 Series II flow injection analysis system with coupled ion chromatograph system (FIA-IC) to provide a high throughput automated analysis of nutrient and ions for samples from surface and ground waters, soil extracts, digested solid sample, and other samples that might be required by researchers. The modular construction of the system allows parallel analysis or independent analysis of samples using the FIA and IC components of this integrated system using EPA approved methods. The fast processing time will ensure that all users will have access to the instrument for their research, and the purchase of this single, shared equipment is more efficient than having each lab develop and conduct their own manual spectrophotometric analyses. The acquisition of this instrument will allow rapid throughput of samples from existing studies but will facilitate the expansion of research projects in the Biological, Geological, and Agricultural Sciences at Illinois State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A primary goal of Illinois State University is to provide an accessible small-school learning experience with the opportunities of a big university, and our education, research, and outreach activities will be substantially enhanced with the acquisition of the FIA-IC. The FIA-IC will raise the level of current analyses in classes including Human Physiology, Stream Ecology, Limnology, Soil Fertility and Fertilizers, and Environmental Geology Field Methods. The FIA-IC will be incorporated into existing K-12 outreach programs that involve student groups from Chicago urban districts and local rural districts to further expose high school students to scientific research through either age-appropriate learning modules or independent research during the summer. Researchers from Northern Illinois University, University of Illinois - Springfield and University of Illinois Champaign Urbana, will also use the instrument. Acquisition of the FIA-IC will constitute a central piece of equipment needed in the development of an interdisciplinary-based environmental analytical center bridging the disciplines of Biological, Geological, Agricultural and Chemical Sciences. The instrument will be operated and administratively managed as a cost-center at Illinois State University and will promote research particularly on water quality within an agricultural and urban setting.</AbstractNarration>
