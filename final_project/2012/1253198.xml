    <AbstractNarration>Soils are chemical reactors. In this vast and diverse crucible that covers the earth surface, minerals undergo a series of physical and chemical reactions with organic matter. These reactions, by controlling the longevity of organic carbon in soils, contribute to the global carbon cycle and act as a control on atmospheric CO2 levels. Little is known, however, about how such reactions are influenced by the supply of minerals into these soil reactors. This study will test a hypothesis that tectonic action, by physically and chemically exposing rock-originated minerals to the Earth's biologically active surface, regulates carbon-mineral interactions. Conversely, in tectonically quiet places, human land-use plays a dominant role as plows replace tectonics, physically mixing minerals and organic matter and facilitating their interactions. This study ultimately attempts to build and empirically test a universal model of carbon-mineral interactions over a gradient from tectonically active rugged terrains (Coastal California and Sierra Nevada California) to tectonically quiet agricultural plains (Midwestern Corn Belt and Atlantic Coastal Plains). Such a global survey of soils will be integrated into an experiential learning module on soil sustainability in an "Environmental Problem Solving" course that is required for all undergraduate students majoring in Environmental Science, Policy, and Management at the University of Minnesota. Students will be guided to build their knowledge base on soil sustainability by collaboratively developing educational materials and using the materials to inform and engage the general public on issues of long-term soil sustainability. The researcher also plans to revise his graduate course on soil formation in order to dramatically boost graduate students? real world experience in conducting science.</AbstractNarration>
