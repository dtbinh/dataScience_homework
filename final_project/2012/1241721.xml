    <AbstractNarration>This project launches the CyberCorpsÂ®: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at Kansas State University (K-State), designated by NSA and DHS as a National Center of Academic Excellence of Cybersecurity Research (CAE-R). The new SFS program at Kansas State University provides highly valuable and timely education and career opportunities for a large student body interested in cybersecurity and information assurance. It builds upon existing strong research and education programs at K-State, and is intended to attract a steady stream of about six incoming SFS scholars per year. The project builds a scholarship program that emphasizes personalized programs of study and individual, one-on-one mentoring throughout students' academic careers, including job search and placement. The project team leverages their ties with other regional schools and proximity to military bases like Fort Riley and Fort Leavenworth to recruit students of all ages and backgrounds, targeting a uniquely diverse, under-served, and underrepresented population. A major feature of the program design is an emphasis on close faculty/student interaction. Each student has an SFS faculty mentor who works closely with the student to develop an individualized study plan, monitors progress, helps the student formulate a career plan and provides advice and assistance in looking for employment both for internships and final placement after graduation. This hands-on, personalized approach helps ensure retention and quality learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SFS project involves the participation of the Manhattan Area Technical College.</AbstractNarration>
