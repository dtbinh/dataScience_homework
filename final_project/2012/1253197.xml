    <AbstractNarration>The observed decline in global biodiversity has fueled rapid growth in research linking biodiversity with measurements of ecosystem function. For example, generally positive associations are observed between the total number of species in an ecosystem (or species richness) and its productivity. However, studies that examine subsets of species, such as predators and their prey, often do not support these more general trends. Without greater knowledge of the mechanisms at this finer scale, conservation of predators and their associated ecosystem functions is difficult. This project will establish a large-scale field experiment to examine how the species richness and spatial distributions of urban patches combine to affect how predatory arthropods identify and capture prey. There are three objectives. The first is to document how patch and landscape heterogeneity affect overlap in arthropod diets, which will be used as a measure of resource partitioning. The second is to test how changes in heterogeneity affect predation amounts and patterns. The third is ultimately aimed at informing conservation programs and city managers by focusing on how predator arthropods disperse among urban patches and may serve a function as biocontrol agents in cities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cleveland, Ohio is the city chosen as the model for this study. Cleveland contains over 10,000 vacant city lots and the research activities of this project will take place within 64 of these vacant parcels. Decisions regarding vacant land management will shape the ecological and social quality of inner-city neighborhoods for decades to come. Therefore, understanding the biological composition of these habitats, how they are distributed, and how they influence important biological groups is a critical task. This project will also provide hands-on opportunities for high school students to conduct field ecology research and become involved in a new Prey Buffet Program, along with learning about more sustainable urban gardening and farming practices though the Ohio State University Master Gardener Specialization Program.</AbstractNarration>
