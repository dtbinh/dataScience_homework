    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for research enabling the development of densely packed nano-scale structures to be used in the manufacturing of energy storage devices, such as capacitors. The nanostructures will consist of metal-insulator-metal layers and will optimize the novel utilization of alternating nano laminates (thin atomic layers of material) in trench structures. Nano-sized trenches will be fabricated and atomic layer deposition will be used to fill the trenches with alternating high dielectric constant and wide band gap nanolayers. Trench formation and nanolaminant development will be optimized through structural and chemical characterization using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform (FTIR) analysis, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Optimized structures will be integrated with high performing electrodes as contacts for the electrical testing of capacitance density, breakdown voltage, and leakage current.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon successful completion of this research, the results will transform the lifespan and cost efficiency of energy storage devices for global solutions. The outcomes of this research will lead to improved nanostructure processing and equivalent planar capacitance (EPC) performance for energy storage devices. The primary goal of this research is to manufacture nano trench structures with optimized pore size and conformal nanolaminant coverage to impact capacitor properties, assembly, and scalability for energy storage. The developed nanostructures will optimize material reliability, durability, and lower processing cost. These resulting metal-insulator-metal trench nanostructures will address long term life cycle, low efficiency, and high leakage current for storage devices used for solar, wind, hydro, and other alternative energy sources.</AbstractNarration>
