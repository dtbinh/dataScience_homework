    <AbstractNarration>This project is focused on developing an in situ particle size spectrometer for particles with radii ranging from 0.1 to 10 micrometers, and suitable for short- and long-term autonomous deployments at remote sites, or on balloon platforms. Immediate applications of the instrument would be to: 1) Replace current instrumentation for stratospheric aerosol profile measurements from Laramie, Wyoming, and 2) Add particle size measurements to equatorial Lagrangian balloons planned for missions in 2016 to 2018. Such measurements are important since aerosol play fundamental roles in the chemistry of mid-latitude stratospheric ozone, and provide one pathway for water to enter the lower stratosphere through penetrating convection, mainly in the tropics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are important societal broader impacts from the scientific measurements possible with new autonomous aerosol spectrometers. Consistent records of stratospheric size distributions are important to refine past estimates of climate and to anticipate future variations, due to unpredictable volcanic eruptions, or possible geo-engineering options. Improving understanding of the flux of species across the tropical tropopause is important to understand and predict the global distribution of stratospheric trace gases and particles, both essential ingredients to climate and chemistry models, which are the primary tools to anticipate long term anthropogenic impacts on the atmosphere in which we live. Such knowledge is needed to inform policy decisions related to a variety of air quality and climate issues. Development of the new instrument and results from it will be published through the peer reviewed literature. Instrumentation developed through the proposal will be available to the department and others for future measurements, in particular the Lagrangian balloon platforms. Participants in the project will gain valuable instrumental, experimental, and scientific experience. While one graduate student is included specifically, all graduate students in the principal investigator's group will participate to some extent in instrument development and testing. The group's activities will be extended to the larger community through public presentations, and participation in the University of Wyoming's Engineering Summer Program for promising high school students.</AbstractNarration>
