    <AbstractNarration>This project will provide scholarships for students with academic merit and unmet financial need pursuing Associates of Science (AS) and Associates of Engineering Science (AES) degrees and transfer opportunities with a concentration in STEM disciplines including Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Mathematics, Computer Science, and Engineering as well as their related fields at the City Colleges of Chicago (CCC). Over the course of three years, 45 - 60 STEM Scholars will be chosen and will benefit from the academic and financial support needed to persist in their endeavors while at CCC, and successfully transfer to a four-year institution. The scholarship program supports students in the second year of studies, covers expenses related to enrollment for their Fall, Spring and Summer semesters, and provides support for enrollment in a class at a Chicago area four-year institution (their transfer destination) during the scholarship period. As STEM Scholars, participants will have access to a wide range of academic and student support services as well as leadership development and community service opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide CCC with opportunities to continue to develop and expand these agreements with four-year institutions on behalf of all CCC STEM students. It will document effective practices for promoting success among a high-need, diverse, urban student population pursuing STEM degrees and serve as a model for other institutions.</AbstractNarration>
