    <AbstractNarration>Parasitic organisms have independently evolved in every major lineage of life on Earth, however we know very little about the transition from free-living to parasite. Red algal parasites are ideal model organisms for investigating the origins of a parasitic life-strategy because most red algal parasites share an immediate common ancestor with a free-living red algal species. Therefore, a single pair of organisms can provide direct comparative data on the genetic changes occurring early in the evolution of a parasite. This project will characterize the co-evolutionary relationship from three species pairs of hosts and their parasites, then establish the effect of a parasitic strategy on their genomes &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide information relevant to dealing with some of the most damaging eukaryotic pathogens and parasites (e.g. , the causes of malaria, toxoplasmosis, sudden oak death, and the Irish Potato Famine). Additionally, red algae are important players in marine and freshwater habitats throughout the world and are among the dominant members of the benthic coastal community. This study will involve the training of undergraduates, a graduate student, and a postdoctoral fellow. URI's highly successful NSF-sponsored Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program will be used to recruit undergraduate and graduate researchers.</AbstractNarration>
