    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports a workshop to determine community-defined strategic direction for Real Time GPS (RTGPS) position data products and formats. High-rate real time positions based on RTGPS data improve temporal resolution of observations of natural processes and are likely to improve the understanding of earthquakes, seismic wave propagation, volcanic eruptions, magmatic intrusions, movement of ice, landslides, and structure and dynamics of the atmosphere. RTGPS-based positions may also have substantial impacts on the ability to assess natural hazards in near real time, including source characterization of large earthquake, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions, directly influencing how science and society prepare and react to these hazards. Well-defined data products and formats will allow the integration of these data with data streams from other areas of geodesy, seismology, and cryospheric and atmospheric science, helping to realize the true potential of this valuable resource. A three-day workshop is planned for late March 2012 in Boulder, Colorado and will bring together approximately 50 geoscientists and students with experience and interests in defining data products and formats based on RTGPS data. The organizing committee will produce a final workshop report that will make community-based recommendations RTGPS data products and formats that serve the broad scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
