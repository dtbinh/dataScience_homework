    <AbstractNarration>With the support of this CAREER Award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program at the National Science Foundation, Professor Susanne Striegler, of the Department of Chemistry at Auburn University will focus on developing a novel method for selective glycosylation by examining templated microgels as catalysts. The studies planned utilize challenging syntheses of glycosides and metal complexes, and will employ inhibition assays to provide crucial information on the use of the designed transition state analogues as enzyme inhibitors. Modern spectroscopic and calorimetric methods will be applied to provide fundamental insights into the coordination behavior between the synthesized transition state analogues and copper(II) complexes. Emulsion polymerization will be employed to immobilize the azaglycoside-metal complex assemblies into templated microgels that will function as soluble, homogenous catalysts. The material obtained will be characterized by kinetic experiments to probe the metal complex accelerated glycoside cleavage, i.e. glycosyl transfer to water. The results of this study will provide the foundation for novel macromolecular catalysts as an alternative to conventional syntheses and enzymatic approaches and open new directions towards the synthesis of glycoconjugates with prospective pharmacological effect. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this CAREER award Professor Stiegler will significantly enhance the current knowledge on transition state analogues to act as both inhibitors of enzymes and templates for the preparation of advanced synthetic materials. Foundations are being laid for the development of sophisticated macromolecular catalysts, which transfer glycosyl moieties to complex acceptors other than water. The studies proposed also open new research directions for the preparation of efficient, macromolecular enzyme mimics based on coordinative bonds. The experimental demonstration mini-course will highlight the merits of chemistry and provide connections to daily life. Explanations of a visible phenomenon will spark interest for sciences in an audience that will include students from nearby, historically black high schools and colleges, e.g. Bullock County High School or Tuskegee University, their teachers and instructors, and other interested members of the public. Research opportunities in the PI's laboratory include a summer research project and a short organic synthesis course for students from local high schools. Hands-on experience in organic chemistry and networking opportunities will be offered to further manifest the students' interest in a career in chemistry. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this program will be trained at the interface of chemistry and biology. They will obtain skills to perform (in)organic syntheses including polymerizations, conduct spectroscopic and calorimetric characterization of coordination events, and determine kinetic profiles of enzymes and synthetic catalysts. Additionally, they will participate in outreach programs to the general public with particular focus on the African-American students in rural Alabama.</AbstractNarration>
