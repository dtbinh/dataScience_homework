    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;#1239560&lt;br/&gt;Rafailovich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to test whether spontaneous nucleation of fibrinogen fibers occurs in these hydrophobic areas, possibly explaining this link. They propose to simulate the arterial wall by producing lipid bilayers, where cholesterol and other fatty acids are added. They will then use SPM, in conjunction with Raman and FTIR to determine the role of the rafts on fibrinogen adsorption, fibrilogenesis , and thrombosis. They will also experiment with different types of fats, and the findings will be used to screen different therapies to prevent their accumulation. The work proposed will be conducted mostly at the FDA, White Oak Facility, in collaboration with Drs. Katherine Vorvolakos and Dinesh Patwardhan. Human fibrinogen will be isolated and purified at Stony Brook University, as part of a collaboration with Dennis Gallanakis, MD, Director of the SBU Hospital Blood Bank and recognized expert on fibrinogen. Dr. Gallanakis keeps an inventory of different fibrinogen fractions and antibodies specific to different segments of the molecule. Functionalized polymers will be synthesized at Stony Brook, brought to White Oak where the spun cast substrates will be prepared and the adsorption experiments conducted. Lipid bilayer films with incorporated fat rafts will be prepared at SBU, and subsequent analysis which will be conducted at White Oak.</AbstractNarration>
