    <AbstractNarration>This research project will analyze data from the Educational Longitudinal Study and the Beginning Postsecondary Study by using hierarchical linear modeling and propensity score matching methods to investigate: (a) how gendered differences in subjective orientations change over time in relation to completion of relevant gateway courses in secondary and postsecondary school, and (b) how these orientations influence persistence in computer science and engineering fields. The researchers will also be utilizing smart-phone technology to conduct experience sampling methods and obtain data on subjective experiences associated with enrollment in gateway computer science and engineering courses from first-year undergraduate students. They will analyze this data in combination with retrospective and administrative data obtained from the same student population to explore relationships with (a) students? initially selected preference for a major prior to matriculation, and (b) the majors they declare at the end of their second year of postsecondary study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The under-representation of females in many STEM fields, particularly computer science and engineering, continues to be a striking labor force statistic. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the factors influencing females choices to stay on or move off of carer trajectories in computer science and engineering. Such information is vital to devising programs and policies to keep females, in particular, on track to complete the undergraduate programs of study necessary to pursue careers in computer science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
