    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant supports an inter-disciplinary research collaboration between engineers and cognitive scientists to understand development of creativity in undergraduate engineering students. The study focuses on electrical engineering students, and uses a series of validated measures to understand the development of creativity in the junior and senior years. Data will be acquired using mobile "apps" that will be developed during the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to help engineering faculty and course designers better understand how to develop and enhance engineering students' creativity. The project, if successful, has the potential to inform efforts to create a more innovative workforce. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.</AbstractNarration>
