    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry supports the research efforts of Professor Guangbin Dong of the University of Texas at Austin to explore new catalytic reactions for the formation of carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds through ketone alkylation reactions. Professor Dong's group uses a transition metal catalyzed enamine-mediated carbon-hydrogen (C-H) functionalization strategy to transform simple, unactivated olefins. This new reaction offers a number of advantages over the classical ketone-akylation methods, including the substitution of expensive or toxic halide reactants with more environmentally benign and less costly olefins, the use of neutral catalytic conditions rather than stoichiometric amounts of strong bases, and the development of a by-product free process. Professor Dong is actively engaged in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) IMPACT Program for undergraduate mentoring, the Welch Summer Scholar Program for high school student training, and the "Shadow a Scientist" program for the early education of middle school and home-schooled students. Professor Dong is also collaborating with UT Austin's Student Veteran Services to create research opportunities for veterans and pre-veterans by providing training in Green Chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one of the oldest and most-utilized carbon-carbon bond formation reactions, ketone alkylation, has not been an economical or environmentally-friendly process. This CAREER project utilizes transition metal-based catalytic processes to avoid the need for corrosive bases and/or toxic and expensive reagents. The improved reactions are expected to have impact in the preparation of pharmaceutical agents, polymers, fine chemicals, and flavoring reactions. Professor Dong stresses the environment and the use of sustainable processes in his work with middle and high school students as well as in the home-school environment. These activities involved participants from diverse age groups and backgrounds. His outreach and education efforts also involve creating research opportunities for veterans and students readying for deployment so that they can be employed by the chemical industry after their military service.</AbstractNarration>
