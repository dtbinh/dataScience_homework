    <AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Science of Learning Centers Program in the Division of Behavioral, Cognitive and Social Sciences in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences; the Perception, Action, and Cognition Program in the Division of Behavioral, Cognitive and Social Sciences in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences; the Energy, Power, and Adaptive Systems Program in the Division of Electrical Communication and Cyber Systems in the Directorate of Engineering; and the Applied Mathematics and Mathematical Biology Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. This research project draws on knowledge from many disciplines (neuroscience, cognitive science, computational science, mathematics and engineering) to create cognitive systems capable of interpreting observed, complex human movements and actions. New design methodologies will be developed for the integration of sensory modalities (vision, audition, touch) and their support of higher cognitive function (language, reasoning). In contrast to existing approaches which tend to be assemblies of modular components each solving its task in isolation, this team takes a novel approach called Active Cognition which has the following features: 1) Instead of modeling the different perceptual processes (vision, audition, and haptics), cognition, and motor control in isolation, the modules are integrated and capabilities co-developed in the tradition of dynamical systems theory to obtain a reasoning system where "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts"; 2) instead of segregating the low level processing of signals from the processing of higher level symbolic information, they will interact in a continuous dialogue, such that high level knowledge will leverage perception; and 3) instead of separating physical embodiment from algorithmic considerations, biologically inspired real-time hardware will be developed that implements complex functions by integrating signals and symbols. The project is organized in two working groups. The first group will develop a cognitive robot that can recognize complex human activities using visual and auditory signals captured by biological-inspired hardware. The second group will study attention in humans by measuring human response to audition and vision through EEG and MEG, and subsequently implementing the findings in robots. A yearly three-week, hands-on workshop will educate students, serve as testing ground for the team's ideas, and stimulate new collaborations. This workshop will also engage the involvement of the interdisciplinary research community that has formed around the goal of building biologically inspired cognitive systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success in integrating different components of a cognitive system (hardware, sensors, and software) has the potential to catalyze a new industry of biologically-inspired cognitive systems, including household and service robots, and systems for intelligent transportation and smart manufacturing. In addition, this interdisciplinary project will play a significant role in building capacity for a new emphasis area in engineering and training of cognitive systems engineers who need combined expertise in computer science, electrical engineering and cognitive neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>
