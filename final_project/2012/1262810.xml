    <AbstractNarration>This award funds the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Toledo. The site will support ten students/year selected from across the US in the ten week summer research program. The department provides a great diversity of cutting-edge research opportunities (both experimental and theoretical) for undergraduate students in: Astrophysics; Atomic/Molecular/Optical Physics; Biological/Health/Medical Physics; and Condensed Matter/Materials Science Physics (with specialization in thin films and photovoltaics). Opportunities exist for some of the research projects to be conducted with their faculty mentors at national facilities (NREL, DCT, NTF, or similar). The research projects are chosen such that the student projects will lead to eventual publication in the appropriate professional research journals. REU students have coauthored over 50 refereed publications (16 in the past five years alone). The REU students are also encouraged to present their research at professional meetings. The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
