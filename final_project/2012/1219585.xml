    <AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. T. Douglas Price of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, together with American and Mexican colleagues, will use cutting-edge methods for the analysis of ancient human skeletons to study patterns of human movement and cultural change over time in the ancient Maya civilization in northern Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. The research focuses on the dramatic changes that took place there between roughly 500 and 1000 AD. This area witnessed substantial population movement for a variety of reasons including colonization, warfare, and climate change. These changes likely involved the movement of outsiders into this region. Questions concerning population mobility, conquest, colonization, and trade are paramount. This project is designed to identify the non-local individuals who came to this area and to better understand patterns of movement and interaction across ancient Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Movement will be assessed by measuring the isotopic composition of human teeth. Tooth enamel forms during early childhood and its chemical composition remains largely unchanged through life and after death. These isotope ratios vary geographically across Mesoamerica and can provide a signature for place of birth. The researchers will measure strontium and oxygen isotope ratios in approximately 400 samples from a series of archaeological sites in the northern Maya region and compare these values among the sites and with similar information from elsewhere is Mesoamerica. They will also examine the remains of some 40 sacrificial victims from the Sacred Cenote at Chichén, seeking information on place of origin for this unusual group of individuals. This information will allow the identification of individuals of non-local origin and in some cases will suggest their place of origin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to determine rates of movement and differences related to age, sex, and/or status, in order to characterize patterns of mobility in this region. Where possible, the research will investigate chronological changes in mobility. This will allow one to put available information from major centers like Chichén Itza and others in comparative context and consider the commonalities and distinctions among these centers. The research will provide insight into how human mobility effected cultural change in the Maya region in the past. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides an opportunity to resolve important archaeological questions about human migration in a major culture area of the New World, including the rates and sources of movement into important centers, the place of origin of certain individuals, relationships between different groups, and differences in migration based on age, gender, and status. The project is international and multidisciplinary. The study will demonstrate the application of new scientific methods to old archaeological questions and involve a number of archaeologists in discussion of the results. It is anticipated that at least one PhD thesis, and the instruction of a number of students in laboratory work and preparation of samples will result from this project. Student training is an important goal. Publication of the results of the study will provide important information for future studies and increase understanding of ancient Mesoamerica.</AbstractNarration>
