    <AbstractNarration>The collection of full-scale dynamic wind pressure on residential roofs during land falling hurricanes is important for determining how to cost effectively reduce damage in hurricanes. Wind tunnel technology has been used for wind pressure measurements on small scale models. These pressures need to be correlated with data collected on real structures in actual high wind events. The proposed research pursues the means to accurately measure wind loads on the roofs of residential buildings during land falling hurricanes. A self-contained portable roof pressure monitoring system is under development. The objectives of the project are to finalize the sensor assembly, to conduct controlled experiments, to develop statistical algorithms to validate the collected data, and to extend the underpinning technology to wind velocity data collection. The research will advance basic knowledge concerning the wind pressures experienced by homes during extreme weather events. A well-defined understanding of such wind loads will have major implications on the development of methods to mitigate wind damage. Students working on the project will gain experience in sensor technology, and in structural and hurricane engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will address the characterization and modeling of dynamic wind loads on complex shaped full-scale residential structures during land falling hurricanes. Scale model tests in boundary layer wind tunnels have been an important tool for the derivation of appropriate design wind loads found in the ASCE 7 Wind Load Provisions. Questions have been raised concerning the ability of wind tunnel simulations to accurately determine peak loads from strong wind events, emphasizing the need to compare wind tunnel with full-scale loads. This is a significant issue that can alter the current knowledge of the wind vulnerability of residential construction along the entire hurricane prone U.S. coast. A self-contained portable roof pressure monitoring system has been developed for rapid deployment and collection of roof pressure data during land falling hurricanes. Data collection among multiple units on the same structure is synchronized to quantify spatial correlation and aggregate wind loads. The physical profile of the individual units may interfere with the dynamic pressure being measured in some flow regimes. These scenarios will be identified experimentally in a controlled laboratory environment, and post-processing algorithms developed to evaluate which portions of sensor records should be retained for analysis. The underpinning technology developed for the pressure measuring units will be adapted to interface with anemometers in order to characterize lateral length scales in ground-level hurricane winds. The proposed full-scale data collection in the field is needed to evaluate wind load modeling and prescriptive design loads. With this knowledge, a risk-consistent framework for the sustainability and future development of the coastal infrastructure will be possible.</AbstractNarration>
