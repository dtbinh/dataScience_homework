The center is building a culture of collaboration among colleges and universities to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* promote the growth of cybersecurity education programs nationally, especially in community colleges;&lt;br/&gt;* build program and faculty capacity by sharing replicable models of excellence;&lt;br/&gt;* promote the cybersecurity profession through a national dissemination program;&lt;br/&gt;* strengthen student capacity and expand pathways to cybersecurity careers; and&lt;br/&gt;* support research on cybersecurity education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By promoting "models of excellence," CyberWatch is expanding high-quality cybersecurity programs at community colleges around the nation. The center is mentoring colleges to achieve the Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education - 2 Year (CAE2Y) designation; increasing students' awareness of cybersecurity careers and their participation in cybersecurity competitions at the K-12 and college levels; growing the number of faculty able to teach cybersecurity topics; assisting with curriculum development at all levels; expanding the knowledge base of what works (and what does not) in cybersecurity education at all levels; and continuing effective dissemination mechanisms, including the center's Web sites, newsletters, reports, conference presentations, and workshops and institutes, all of which advertise the center's services to a broad community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a national center, CyberWatch is leading the effort to bring cybersecurity education at community colleges to the forefront of the national dialogue, thereby helping employers across the nation to meet a critical workforce need.</AbstractNarration>
