    <AbstractNarration>This research is motivated by the need for robust and intelligent clinical procedure of 'catheterization' which is widely used in medical communities. In this research, the fundamental framework to develop active catheters using an electro-active polymer called Ionic Polymer-Metal Composite (IPMC). The research work includes the design and fabrication methodologies of robotically controlled IPMC catheters as well as shape controls needed for use in complex passages. The research results will be disseminated in technical conferences and workshops as well as prototype demonstration. Knowing that the catheter based medical therapy/diagnosis is one of important medical technologies and all existing catheters in the market are based upon human operations, this active catheter technology will pave the way to a new biorobotic medical tool that can significantly contribute to improving quality of life.</AbstractNarration>
