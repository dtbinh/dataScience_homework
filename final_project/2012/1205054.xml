    <AbstractNarration>Clarion University's Venango Campus is piloting a NanoManufacturing concentration within its Industrial Technology 2-year associates in applied science degree (AAS-IT), which provides workforce proficiency in nanotechnology. The students receive an AAS in Industrial Technology and a NanoFabrication Manufacturing Technology (NMT) certificate from Penn State University. The NanoManufacturing concentration within the AAS-IT requires the core math and science courses of 4-year science degrees, an immersion semester at Penn State University's Nanofabrication Center and a practical capstone offered as a NanoManufacturing course. The NanoManufacturing capstone course is a hands-on lecture and laboratory course that provides fundamental skills necessary to work in a nanotechnology production environment and to prepare the students for the immersion semester. The course discusses theoretical concepts behind research, development, production, and processing of nano-scaled materials. The course is conducted within the Center for Applied Research &amp; Intellectual Property Development in order to expose the students to local industries. The courses at Penn State University are offered through the ATE National Center NACK. The project is providing an increased educational foundation for technicians to keep up with the rapid development in the current and emerging industrial fields. The project has outreach to regional K-12 schools, teachers, displaced workers, veterans, and has established a regional industry advisory board.</AbstractNarration>
