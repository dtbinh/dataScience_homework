    <AbstractNarration>In nature, the relationship between the two genders is often far from harmonious. For example, because sperm are generally cheaper to produce than eggs, males tend to want to mate more often than females do, resulting in sexual conflict over mating decisions. To date, considerable research has documented how male sexual harassment negatively affects female fitness. However, we know very little about how anti-harassment traits of female affect male fitness. The dissertation research investigates the role of males in sexual conflict in a damselfly whose males are bright blue, but whose females may be either a male-like blue (i.e. a male "mimic") or female-specific green. The proposed experiment measures the cost of males making mating mistakes in the presence of blue females. This study will be among the first attempts to measure the fitness effect of female traits on males in a natural habitat. The Co-PI also proposes to build a computer model for the economy (i.e., costs and benefits) of male mating harassment, and hence, addresses the fundamental, yet neglected question of when is it economically optimal for a male to harass a female. This model generalizes the findings from this dissertation research to a more general context, and its predictions are applicable to a broader range of animals. The dissertation research has provided fieldwork experience for STEM undergraduate students. The research will be presented and involve non-STEM students through lectures designed for English Composition students. The Co-PI also plans to develop a ballet to demonstrate science behind her dissertation research in a layman-friendly form. The making of this ballet will be an exploration of using art as an alternative tool in science education, and in outreach activities for K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>
