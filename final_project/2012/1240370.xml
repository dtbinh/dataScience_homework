    <AbstractNarration>The 2012 Midwest Geometry Conference will take place May 12-13, 2012 at the University of Oklahoma, located in Norman, Oklahoma. The conference will highlight recent developments and new research directions in a number of areas that include (but are not limited to): p-harmonic geometry, minimal varieties, geometric flows, complex and Riemannian geometry, conformal geometry, geometry of submanifolds, convex geometry, stochastic geometry, algebraic geometry, geometric measure theory, metric geometry, partial differential equations, several complex variables, Finsler geometry, mathematical physics, and related problems. They represents a wide spectrum of the topic. As a complement of the talks in the conference, the participants will have considerable opportunities to have discussions with the speakers and each other. The Midwest Geometry Conference had been an annual meeting since its founding in 1991 until 2007. This 2012 conference is committed to revive the Midwest Geometry Conference, in addition to bring in researchers of national and international statue, and students around the world to discuss their research and to interact with mathematicians and students from the Midwest and other regions at all levels. Summaries of talks are publicly reported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a wonderful event or phenomenon in mathematics that the results of one discipline of thought have startling and unexpected consequences in another. The conference is a valuable networking opportunity, as well as a great venue for dialogue on mathematical concepts, ideas, methods, problems, collaborations, and the direction of mathematics. By design, the Midwest Geometry Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the exchange of ideas among members of the geometry community in the Midwest, as well as dissemination of important recent advances, nationwide and worldwide, in differential geometry, geometric analysis, integral geometry, and related fields in the broad sense. This helps cement research collaborations, brother-sister-hood, and mathematical contact. Second, the conference is committed to create a focused environment, conducive to a lively exchange of ideas, in which members of this regional community can benefit from each other's ideas, and from contact with leading geometers from outside the region. The intent of the conference is to be a top-drawer, cutting-edge research conference, attempting (as much as resources permit) to bring in the appropriate speakers at all levels, independent of where they are based. The conference will reflect, complement, or interact the main areas of focus of geometers in the Midwest. Funds will be used to for the travel and hosting costs for speakers, and participants. Minorities, women, persons with disabilities, graduate students, and junior faculty are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Prior to the conference, experienced conference participants will present one or more introductory warm-up talks for interested graduate and undergraduate students. Public talks will address audiences for the public at large. Other events include Professor Shihshu Walter Wei's third (volunteer) graduate course without extra pay, Math 6683 Differential Geometry II at the University of Oklahoma in the spring of 2012, providing a general background for the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More details for the conference can be found at www2.math.ou.edu/~wwei/mgc2012.html</AbstractNarration>
