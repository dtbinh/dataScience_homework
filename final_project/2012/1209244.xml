    <AbstractNarration>This action funds Yvonne Kung of Stanford University to conduct a research project, entitled "Using computer simulations to develop more efficient materials for power lines," during the summer of 2012 at the National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan. The host scientist is Ying-Jer Kao.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the research project is increasing our understanding of materials with novel and potentially useful electronic properties, especially high-temperature superconductors, using computer simulations. The research investigates strong electron-phonon coupling in strongly correlated electron systems by extending the tensor product state (TPS) method to fermion systems. This additional computational technique allows the development of an overarching theory for strongly correlated materials. An expected longterm outcome is to further understanding of high-temperature superconductors, which would potentially lead to decreasing power loss in electrical wires and revolutionize the power grid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow with a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
