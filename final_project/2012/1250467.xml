    <AbstractNarration>The Emory Department of Mathematics and Computer Science REU is a research experience for undergraduates interested in arithmetic geometry, combinatorics, and number theory. Organized by Ken Ono (with assistance from rotating colleagues), the program plans to train ten undergraduates annually in the summers of 2013, 2014, and 2015. Research problems will be accessible and cutting edge, and they will be related to analytic number theory, elliptic curves, Galois representations, modular forms, partitions, and quantum modular forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants will be chosen from a nationwide search. At least half will be chosen from underrepresented groups, and at least half will be chosen from institutions which do not offer many similar STEM research activities for undergraduates. The REU program will enable undergraduate students to enjoy an enhanced learning experience, including research projects and seminars. The overall goal of the Emory REU in Number Theory is to attract talented undergraduate students to careers in the mathematical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
