    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant brings together an interdisciplinary group of engineering and education researchers to conduct mixed-method study of how formal and informal interactions with engineering faculty and professionals influence the attitudes and intentions of under-represented students. The study will utilize a social capital theoretical framework to explore decision points in students' progression through an engineering degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arises from the focus on students traditionally under-represented in engineering as well as the ability of the project to inform how mentoring and advising can be structured to improve retention or other outcomes in engineering degree programs. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>
