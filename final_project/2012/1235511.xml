    <AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation project investigates the ways in which rural migrants establish livelihoods and gain access to urban space via informal recycling and trash collecting. Although recycling contributes value by removing waste from cities and channeling materials back into commodity production, new rural-urban migrants in developing and emerging countries are often viewed as 'uncivilized' by established urban residents. Thus, migrant recyclers are paradoxically objectified as both paragons of entrepreneurial virtue and unsanitary urban interlopers. In some countries tensions arise as state entities seek to control flows of both urban waste and rural migrants within the city. Arguing that access to urban space and waste is a crucial determinant for the success of migrant recyclers, this project connects the shifting experiences and conceptions of mobility, citizenship and identity with the structures impacting their livelihoods. This project builds on the hypothesis that informal recycling's creation of social and economic value represents a strategy of urban citizenship, and reveals the contradictions underlying state and public visions of modern urban development. By considering the case of urban recycling in Shanghai, this research uses a mixed methodology of surveys, statistical and discourse analysis, interviews, focus groups, and mobile ethnography, uniting studies in urban development, migration, and the regional geography of China. There are two research questions the project hopes to answer are: (1) how is informal recycling structured in metropolitan Shanghai? (2) How is access to urban space and resources for newly urban residents engaged in recycling as a livelihood conditioned, limited, and enabled by these structures?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research promotes cross-cultural and interdisciplinary research among China and US scientists and policy-makers by demonstrating the benefits and values of informal recycling networks and they in which these have the potential for stabilizing newly urban populations. It argues for positive recognition of the contributions of marginalized groups to sustainable urban development. The resulting dissertation will be published in Mandarin Chinese and English, and disseminated to local university departments and the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences (SASS). Scholarly articles produced from this research will be submitted to US academic journals and presented at conferences of development, migration, and China studies. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project provides support to a promising student working towards establishing a social science research career.</AbstractNarration>
