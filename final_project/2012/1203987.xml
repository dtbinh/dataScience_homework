    <AbstractNarration>The award is cover partial travel support to approximately 40 US participants to attend the "IPY 2012: From Knowledge to Action Conference," International Polar Year (IPY) conference to be held in April 2012 in Montreal, Canada. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on results and best practices from the IPY 2007-2008 activities, the conference will bring together over 2,000 Arctic and Antarctic researchers, policy- and decision-makers, and interested parties from academia, industry, non-government, education, Arctic communities, and circumpolar indigenous peoples. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In awarding the travel funds, preference will be given to applicants from under-represented groups, young scientists, and students; those presenting oral and/or posters at the conference; and those that are actively involved in research related to the program theme. Travel support will also be offered to a small number of educators who are actively engaged in presenting information on polar studies in their classrooms. In addition, selection for travel-grant awards will be based on disciplinary balance, geographical location, interest in polar-related activities, a balance of Antarctic and Arctic participation, financial need, and the ability to assume some of the travel costs.</AbstractNarration>
