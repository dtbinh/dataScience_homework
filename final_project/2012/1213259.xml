    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, the research group of Professor Oliver Steinbock (Florida State University, FSU) will investigate self-organizing wave patterns in autocatalytic reaction-diffusion systems. These far-from-equilibrium systems are a treasure trove for 21st century science. They create intricate regulatory networks, exhibit fascinating dynamics, and generate information-relaying patterns that one typically expects to find only in biology. The project focuses on understudied processes in three-dimensional excitable media and specifically on rotating scroll waves. These dissipative structures are formed by propagating regions of autocatalytic activity and trailing "refractory zones" of high inhibitor concentration. The primary goal is to establish a complete description of vortex pinning and vortex unpinning in three-dimensional excitable systems. An important example is the distinction between true pinning to small heterogeneities and mere surface termination of the vortices' rotation backbone. Experiments will include weakly excitable, curved, and moving heterogeneities that should allow the active repositioning and reshaping of scroll waves. These challenging studies can be pursued using photochemical methods and/or computer-controlled motion of solid objects. The latter approach will induce fluid flow in the reactive solution but should not affect pattern stability below threshold values that the will be characterized systematically during the project. If successful, these studies will also provide a novel approach to chemo-hydrodynamic systems. Another goal is to demonstrate and analyze the unpinning of scroll rings from heterogeneities in BZ-gel systems using externally controlled electric fields and temperature gradients. The project will test a hypothesis that unpinning can proceed via tilting of the scroll ring relative to the pinning, torus-shaped anchor or alternatively via radial expansion. These investigations will be complemented by kinematic modeling efforts and computational studies of three-dimensional reaction-diffusion models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the chemical research under this project is motivated by the self-organization of living systems. A striking example is the motion of electrical patterns in the human heart that orchestrate the healthy or disturbed pump action of this vital organ. Spinning, vortex-like states have been linked to tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation with the latter being among the leading causes of death for Americans. Highly reproducible experiments with simpler chemical systems have and will reveal important insights into these states. The research team around Prof. Steinbock will specifically investigate how such vortices are changed, reshaped, and possibly stabilized by less active regions. In the context of the heart such regions correspond to scar tissue caused by traumatic events such as heart attacks. This multi-faceted research is also ideally suited for the modern training of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students. Furthermore Prof. Steinbock will continue his firm commitment to foster underrepresented groups and participate in mentoring programs that aim to increase their leadership roles in research and academia. Specific activities include the production of videos for FSU's Global Educational Outreach Program and YouTube. In addition, Prof. Steinbock will participate in FSU's Honors Research Program for first-year students and contribute to the "Saturday Morning Physics" lecture series for local pre-college students.</AbstractNarration>
