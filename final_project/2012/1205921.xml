    <AbstractNarration>In this project, the PIs will investigate the relationship between mechanical properties of the cell and physiological response, using bioluminescence as a fast reporter of mechanosensitivity. Specific questions to be addressed are: (1) What are the mechanical properties of the cell? (2) How is mechanosensitivity related to the mechanical properties of the cell? and (3) What is the role of the cytoskeleton in determining the mechanical properties of cells and their physiological sensitivity? These issues will be studied in three species of dinoflagellates using atomic force microscopy to measure the elasticity of living cells and apply quantified mechanical stress to cells, microfluidics to subject cells to known levels of fluid shear stress, and laser confocal microscopy coupled with fluorescent probes to visualize the cytoskeleton. Pharmacological treatments that disrupt the cytoskeleton will be examined for their effect on cell elasticity and mechanosensitivity. This collaborative project applies advanced methods of physics, material science, and microfluidic technology to characterize the mechanical properties of the cell and the relationship to physiological sensitivity. The goal of the project is to enhance the value of dinoflagellate bioluminescence as a reporter of mechanical stress for applications in both the biological and physical sciences. This project will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups and advances discovery and understanding by providing internship opportunities to these undergraduate students through UCSD internship programs, the opportunity for a Ph.D. graduate student in the physical sciences to work in an interdisciplinary setting, and for two undergraduate students to participate as REU interns. The project advances discovery and understanding by contributing to the professional development of middle and high school science teachers by developing course materials through the Scripps Classroom Connection Summer Institute in partnership with COSEE CA, and providing demonstration kits of dinoflagellate bioluminescence to their students. Project results will be broadly disseminated through established scientific venues as well as education and public outreach activities through the Birch Aquarium at Scripps.</AbstractNarration>
