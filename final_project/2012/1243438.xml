    <AbstractNarration>The July 9-12, 2012 workshop "Towards in silico biological cells: Bridging experiments and simulations" in Lausanne, Switzerland will bring together researchers from two basic and complementary approaches for simulating the dynamics of cellular processes within the cytoplasm of bacterial cells: particle-based Brownian dynamics algorithms that have been used to describe the diffusive transport in crowded environments and reaction-diffusion master equations that have been used to describe stochastic kinetics of gene expression, genetic switches and biochemical pathways functioning in modeled biological cells. This Workshop will provide the opportunity to bring researchers from the scientific fields of molecular simulations and system biology together with experimentalists who are labeling and imaging cellular components. We envision that this cross fertilization will lead to significant scientific advances in the computational modeling of an entire cell, its components, cell division and the coupling of universal processes of transcription and translation to the response of the cell's metabolic network.</AbstractNarration>
