    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to support dissertation research in Taiwan by Ph.D. candidate, Emily Rivest, in her study of the impact of ocean acidification on propagation of ocean corals. Ms. Rivest will undertake joint research with colleagues at the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium (NMMBA) in Taiwan, where she will spend three months conducting experimental tests on the effects of acidity and temperature rise on the physiology, metabolism and survival of coral larvae, specifically Pocillopora damicornis larvae in the planktonic state. The study ranges from the analysis of the whole organism to its genetics and molecular biology. The systematic studies will produce data that can enhance understanding of the changing energy costs of larvae duration under varying stress conditions, which is relevant to sustainability of coral populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the great dangers of global climate change involves the combination of rising ocean temperatures and rising acidity, which results from increased atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide. These increasingly stressful conditions can impact negatively on the sustainability of coral reefs, which are critical to ocean ecology. The results of this study can quantify the risks to coral survival and perhaps guide methods of remediation. Also, the project will enhance the student?s international relationships for future research collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
