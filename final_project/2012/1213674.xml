    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry supports the collaborative research between the Richter-Addo and Shaw groups at the University of Oklahoma and Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, respectively. This research employs advanced electrochemistry techniques to probe the redox and chemical behavior of heme models bearing nitrogen oxides as ligands. Also investigated are the effects that nitrogen oxide ligands have on metalloporphyrin redox behavior, and the effects of the porphyrin scaffold and the trans ligands have on the chemical reactivity of the metal-bound NO groups. Spectroelectrochemistry, using simultaneous chronoabsorptometry and chronoamperometry techniques, will be utilized to derive the UV-vis spectra of unstable redox intermediates to aid in their characterization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitrogen oxides are present in the urban atmosphere and in living systems. Metal centers, such as those present in metalloporphyrins as heme models, regulate the chemistry of these nitrogen oxides. This project will shed insight on both the observed chemistry and redox behavior of newly synthesized complexes containing nitrogen oxides as ligands. The varied complexity of the sub-projects is ideal for the OU-SIUE collaboration, as it provides training appropriate for students at both a Ph.D. institution (OU) and an RUI (SIUE). Educational interactions with a minority-serving institution will be strengthened, as will productive contributions to the Upward Bound programs at both OU and SIUE.</AbstractNarration>
