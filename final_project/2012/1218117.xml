    <AbstractNarration>There is increasing demand to deploy web applications across multiple data&lt;br/&gt;centers to improve fault tolerance and reduce network delays to&lt;br/&gt;users. As application servers need to share data, their&lt;br/&gt;construction can be significantly simplified if a storage backend exists for&lt;br/&gt;applications to seamlessly access replicated data at different data centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A geo-replicated storage system faces the unpleasant tradeoff of consistency&lt;br/&gt;vs. performance because of large inter-data-center communication delay. This&lt;br/&gt;proposal investigates novel consistency and programming models for&lt;br/&gt;geo-replicated storage that are easy-to-use and can achieve good performance.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, this project proposes parallel snapshot isolation, a novel &lt;br/&gt;consistency model that enables efficient implementation with minimal&lt;br/&gt;coordination across data centers. Parallel snapshot isolation provides much&lt;br/&gt;stronger guarantees than existing weak consistency models by disallowing&lt;br/&gt;write-write conflicts and preserving the causality of operations. The PI&lt;br/&gt;builds Walter, a geo-replicated transactional key-value store that guarantees&lt;br/&gt;parallel snapshot isolation. A number of common web applications are written&lt;br/&gt;on top of Walter and evaluations demonstrate that the new consistency model is&lt;br/&gt;easy to program for and enables applications to achieve high performance. The&lt;br/&gt;success of this project will bring much improvement to the state-of-art in&lt;br/&gt;writing scalable and fault tolerant web applications.</AbstractNarration>
