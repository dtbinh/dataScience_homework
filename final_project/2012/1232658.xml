    <AbstractNarration>1232658 (Chong). This workshop will be held at the 2nd International Conference on Sustainable Design, Engineering and Construction in Fort Worth, TX, November 7-9, 2012. The purpose of the workshop is to establish the sciences and research agenda around the theme of sustainability quantification for buildings and infrastructure. The workshop will focus on identifying the knowledge and research needs to support the development of the sciences behind sustainability quantification for building and infrastructure design, engineering and construction (S2QBIDEC), and to initiate a platform to support cross-disciplinary sustainability knowledge exchange. The workshop will establish a network of researchers in the area of sustainability quantification for building and infrastructure design, engineering and construction. Academia and industry participants at the workshop will be multi-disciplinary,coming from the fields of social science, mathematics, engineering, urban planning, architecture, and law. The workshop will bridge a cross-disciplinary knowledge gap and foster closer working relationships between academics and industry professionals. The funds from NSF will be used to support travel for younger faculty and students to attend the S2QBIDEC Workshop (part of ICSDEC 2012 conference). Funded faculty and students will be required to submit concept paper(s) to the conference, which will be used to develop the workshop. The concept papers will also be presented at the conference. A website will be established that publishes and documents the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
