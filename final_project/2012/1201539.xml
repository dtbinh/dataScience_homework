    <AbstractNarration>Travel support is requested for about twenty U.S. participants (recent Ph.D.s, women, and members of underrepresented minority groups) to attend the 8th World Congress on Probability and Statistics to be held in Istanbul, Turkey from 9th to 14th of July, 2012. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Congress is organized under the auspices of the Bernoulli Society for Mathematical Statistics and Probability and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. It is the major worldwide event bringing together researchers working in the fields of statistics, probability and stochastic processes and is held every four years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important part of the intellectual development of researchers at the beginning of their career is to attend international conferences where they have an opportunity to interacts with people working in a wide range of topics. The conference covers a wide range of active research areas and features 14 Invited Plenary Lectures presented by leading specialists. In addition, there will be 40 special Invited Sessions, consisting of three talks each, as well as Contributed and Poster Sessions covering many aspects of applied and theoretical probability, statistics and stochastic processes.</AbstractNarration>
