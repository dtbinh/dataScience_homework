    <AbstractNarration>The trillions of microorganisms that inhabit soils are key components of ecosystems and they are integral to the many services that ecosystems provide. A new DNA sequencing method will be used to catalog, in a level of detail that has not been achieved before, microbial diversity in natural soils along a successional dune chronosequence. The treasure trove of novel bacterial species that is likely to be discovered will enhance our understanding of patterns, causes, and consequences of changing microbial diversity and composition. It will contribute to our understanding of the consequences of introducing microbes into ecosystems for specific purposes such as bioremediation, and to our understanding of factors that may limit the distribution and abundance of potentially disease-causing bacteria. &lt;br/&gt;This research will result in the cross-disciplinary training of one doctoral and three to six undergraduate and high school students in soil biochemistry, microbiology, and molecular ecology. Cooperation with the Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science (MSMS) will result in the recruitment of future undergraduate students for summer research projects. These projects will also help to expand state of the art science projects into a learning experience that will impact High School classrooms. Student research will be highlighted in state competitions such as the State Engineering Fair and the young scientist division at the Mississippi Academy of Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
