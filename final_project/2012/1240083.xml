    <AbstractNarration>The University of Houston Robert Noyce Scholarship Program is addressing the shortage of qualified physics and chemistry teachers through recruitment, preparation and retention of science majors for teacher certification in physics and chemistry. The program, built on the successes of the teachHOUSTON program, annually provides (1) 12 summer internships for lower division undergraduates to work with science master teachers at a middle school STEM camp for underserved students; (2) early field experiences to scholars in high need schools with established partner school districts; (3) $12,000 annual scholarships for 24 junior or senior level physics or chemistry majors or post baccalaureate students seeking physics or chemistry teacher certification who commit to teaching two years in a high-need school district for every year of scholarship support after graduation; and (4) a Physics By Inquiry Course that engages scholars and STEM majors in the teachHOUSTON program in effective inquiry-based teaching pedagogies for physics and chemistry. This project has the potential to provide a total of 24 content knowledgeable physics and chemistry teachers to underserved schools in the Houston area, provide innovative methods for recruitment, preparation and retention of physics or chemistry teachers, and promote active inquiry based methods for teaching, training, and learning physics and chemistry. This program leads to improved teacher content knowledge and enhanced student learning resulting in an increase in the number of students, particularly those from underserved populations, entering into STEM-related professions. Dissemination of knowledge gained from this program is transmitted to STEM and education related conferences.</AbstractNarration>
