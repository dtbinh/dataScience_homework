    <AbstractNarration>This project will aid understanding of the emergence of computer security. It will examine key computer-security concepts and approaches in the domains of government, universities, industry, and criminal justice. Project activities include: [A] Conducting 30 detailed Òresearch gradeÓ oral histories with key figures in the field. Transcripts will be publicly available on the website of the Charles Babbage Institute. [B] Collecting and archiving valuable documentary materials, including reports, correspondence, and grey literature, again to be accessible at CBI. [C] A knowledge networking wiki will describe and discuss key computer-security concepts, approaches, institutions, and frameworks, with input from experts in the computer-security field. The wiki will benefit computer security professionals, policymakers, scholars, students, and the broader society. [D] Publication of peer-reviewed scholarly articles will stimulate further historical attention of this vital area of computing. Collectively these four components will create a much-needed research infrastructure for computer security history. Work has been planned and will be done in close cooperation with an Advisory Committee of recognized leaders in the computer security field. With regard to training, we will carefully mentor a GSRA in the craft of conducting research-grade oral histories. The project team is attuned to documenting and analyzing the role of underrepresented groups in computer security, and disseminating narratives of role models to inspire future scientists. The chief result of the project will be the creation of a public, accessible, and permanent infrastructure of historical materials for better understanding the emergence of computer security.</AbstractNarration>
