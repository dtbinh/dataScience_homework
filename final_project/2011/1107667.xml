    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: This EAGER project is aimed at obtaining free standing quasicrystalline nanoparticles from properly annealed Zirconium-based amorphous alloys through chemical and electrochemical approaches. It is known that metastable quasicrystalline nanoparticles precipitate during the initial crystallization of some Zr-based amorphous alloys. These particles are embedded in the amorphous matrix and transform to stable crystalline phases upon further annealing. The size of the precipitated particles ranges from several to a 100 nanometers. The separation of these nanoparticles from the amorphous matrix will be carried out by chemical and electrochemical approaches. A Zr-based amorphous alloy, in which the precipitation of quasicrystalline nanoparticles has been confirmed, will be either etched chemically or electrochemically. The amorphous matrix will be removed preferentially, enabling the nanoparticles to fall into the solution, after which they will be recovered through filtering. The experimental conditions will be optimized. Due to their reduced sizes and unique atomic configurations, the Zr-rich particles are expected to exhibit novel properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: The particles synthesized in the present project represent a new class of material and are of interest for both fundamental studies and potential medicinal applications or as hydrogen storage materials. The properties of these nanoparticles are expected to differ from their normal crystalline and/or amorphous counterparts because of their nanometer size. The success of the present project could stimulate the demand for such particles for commercial exploitation or for the initiation of joint projects with researchers in other fields. The present project will have a significant impact on the teaching and research activities at Clarion University and will stimulate interest in nanotechnology in nearby institutions. Four undergraduate students will be involved in this project at different stages, providing valuable opportunities to work on real-world problems within the environment of a predominantly teaching university. In addition to publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at professional meetings, the results will be introduced in a nanotechnology course and in a campus-wide seminar series. Clarion University has a very close relationship with local middle and high schools. The results of this project will be introduced to teachers and students in these schools. The principal investigator of the present project is an active member of the National Science Foundation's Nanotechnology Application and Career Knowledge (NACK) Center at Pennsylvania State University. The results of this project will also be communicated to the NACK Center.</AbstractNarration>
