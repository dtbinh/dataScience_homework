    <AbstractNarration>This project is focused on increasing enrollment and graduation rates in industrial engineering, mechanical engineering and physics. The expectation is to serve more than 15 students yearly through the articulation of a seamless transfer from the community clleges. It is particularly noteworthy that the program builds on proven 'in house' methods that have yielded excellent retention results and that it continues to focus on underserved populations. Enhancements to be included are adopting and enhancing a STEM Summer Research Program and a Student Success Center, hiring tutors and research assistants, faculty mentors to help with retention, utilizing good connections with industry, and integrating two good recruitment tools (Girl's Night Out and The Robotic Hand).</AbstractNarration>
