    <AbstractNarration>This project is identifying and developing the skill sets of Principal Investigators in the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program to enhance their acquisition of core knowledge in areas relevant to their project's goals, key skills in the nuts and bolts of project management (e.g., managing people, managing funds, and managing operations) and change leadership (e.g., building and sustaining support among key constituencies, anticipating and adjusting to changing operational conditions, and institutionalizing the project's activities within the core operations of host units). These skill sets are especially critical for more complex projects. Mentorship is a well established academic strategy for building such sets within faculty. This project seeks to explore whether a many-to-many mentorship system can be effectively implemented using electronic means. The system to be implemented is called the NOYCE Principal Investigators Garnering Useful Instruction in Developing [Project] Effectiveness (NOYCE PI GUIDE). The fundamental assumption is that there are answers to key questions as well as guiding strategies that experienced PIs can share with novice PIs (and potential PIs) to significantly aid their ability to successfully achieve the goals of their projects. The project is establishing a web site that features: (a) very short filmed segments and accompanying transcripts introducing fictionalized scenarios derived from interviews conducted with experienced NOYCE PIs, (b) at least 10 short video segments of the experienced NOYCE PIs discussing these two topics, and (c) a moderated electronic community of practice to build peer mentoring networks among would-be, novice and experienced NOYCE PIs.</AbstractNarration>
