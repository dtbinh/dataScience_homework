    <AbstractNarration>EPAS: Hierarchical Characterization of Optoelectronic Hyperdoped Silicon Devices for Terawatt-Scale Photovoltaics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to demonstrate a viable route to production of high-performance hyperdoped silicon photovoltaics (PV). The approach is to determine the fundamental properties of performance-limiting defects in PV devices containing hyperdoped silicon, thus leading to fabrication of next-generation devices. Specifically, we will diagnose the current state-of-the-art devices (demonstrate efficiencies of ~1%) using a hierarchical characterization approach, while creating cost-effective devices with drastically improved performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Hyperdoped materials were discovered 10 years ago and have since drawn interest for their potential photovoltaic applications; yet no significant photovoltaic technology has yet emerged due to a lack of understanding of limiting defects. First, we will carefully characterize and model solar cells fabricated using current hyperdoping methods. Second, we will analyze the fundamental properties of performance-limiting defects, while developing a strategy for how to reduce or eliminate their impact. Lastly, we will fabricate new prototype cells that avoid these pitfalls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Because it is abundant enough to contribute at the terawatt scale, silicon-based PV is excellently positioned to contribute to the dual goals of decreasing our economy's carbon-intensity while improving energy security. The proposed work will also address the NSF?s mission of advancing discovery while promoting teaching, training, learning, and diversity. Using new media including YouTube and Wikipedia, the group will successfully disseminate the impact of the work to the general public.</AbstractNarration>
