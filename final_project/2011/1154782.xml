    <AbstractNarration>Particle accelerators have become the largest and most expensive of scientific instruments. Thirty years ago, a biennial Advanced Accelerator Concepts (AAC) Workshop series began as an effort to bring together U. S. researchers and selected foreign representatives from diverse technical backgrounds to explore new ideas for making accelerators leaner and meaner. The PI is now organizing the 15th AAC workshop, to be held June 10-15, 2012 in Austin, Texas. Student participation is becoming an increasingly important component of these meetings. Recent AAC workshops have featured a student poster session, several best poster student prizes, oral presentations by the winners in the closing plenary session, and partial student scholarships. The upcoming 15th AAC Workshop will continue these features, while increasing student participation from 50 to approximately 60, and for the first time providing a series of tutorials aimed specifically at student attendees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of the use of the funds is to reduce the cost of U. S. student attendance at the 15th AAC Workshop in Austin, Texas. Funds will be distributed as 20 NSF AAC student scholarships of $500 each to qualified student participants from U.S. institutions. Students will be invited to apply for scholarships through an advertisement on the AAC workshop web site and by email. Recipients will be selected by a multi-institutional committee of senior workshop participants based on scientific merit of the students application, letters of recommendation, and institutional balance. Applications from minorities, women, and persons with disabilities will be particularly encouraged.</AbstractNarration>
