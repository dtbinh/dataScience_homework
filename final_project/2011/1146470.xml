    <AbstractNarration>Understanding the processes that lead to the formation of new species is important for understanding the origin of biological diversity. Sterility of hybrid males is one of the most common causes of reproductive isolation between animal species, yet it is unclear if the disruption of sperm development often has a common basis. The proposed research will use several genetic experiments in mice to bridge significant gaps in our understanding of the developmental causes of hybrid male sterility. Genomic experiments will be used to study gene regulation across sperm development in two species of mice and in sterile hybrid males. Comparisons between sterile and fertile males will be used to identify differences in gene regulation that contribute to infertility. These studies will be complemented with genetic mapping experiments focused on identifying specific genes that underlie hybrid male sterility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will advance understanding of the causes of reproductive isolation between species and provide much needed insight into the underpinnings of male sterility. This research will also advance the study of reproductive diseases by providing insights into the developmental basis of male infertility. The proposed activities will provide training and support for postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate researchers and incorporate several outreach activities aimed at high school and undergraduate students with little or no previous exposure to research-based science. These efforts will advance public understanding of biology and increase diversity in science through the inclusion of students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
