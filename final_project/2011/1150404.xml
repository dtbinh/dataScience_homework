    <AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will develop a strong research program to increase the use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) as construction binders in concrete through new levels of chemical characterization. Since SCMs are unwanted material streams from different industrial processes, there is much variability in the materials. The research will use novel particle characterization techniques developed by the PIs research group to better understand, quantify, improve and increase the use of SCMs as construction binders. The objectives are: i) characterize SCMs by coupling particle size and chemistry, through 3D particle chemical mapping, rapid investigation with autonomous scanning electron microscopy, and bulk chemistry, ii) quantify the short term and long term performance of SCMs as concrete binders through strength, permeability, chemical shrinkage and heat of hydration changes over time, iii) understand the mechanisms by which different chemical phases in the SCM impact performance as a concrete binder. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concrete is the second most used commodity in the world. The use of SCMs in concrete has the ability to improve the strength, durability, economy and sustainability of concrete. Current use of SCMs in concrete is limited because of the high variability of the material. This research will provide new fundamental knowledge of chemical phases, their distribution, and how these phases react with hydrating cement paste. Ultimately these interactions will be used to understand how this impacts the properties and performance of the concrete containing the SCM from a few hours to over a year. Furthermore, the techniques established in this research will be useful for a number of applications that require complex particle characterization and allowing time resolved measurements of their reactions and structural changes in different environments. These methods can be applied to biomaterials, pharmaceuticals, geo-materials, polymers, industrial waste products. The educational activities will also increase the awareness level of STEM fields with underrepresented elementary students through the establishment of an after school mentoring program and the creation of online teaching modules.</AbstractNarration>
