    <AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the University of South Alabama that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2012-2014. The program focuses on integrative sciences at the junction of engineering, biology and chemistry, with links to understanding protein structure and function. Undergraduates participating in the program will conduct independent research under the mentorship of faculty, explore the implications of their research with peers and mentors through formal and informal discussion groups, develop an understanding of the ethical implications of the research process and professionalism, and present their research at an end of program symposium. Research projects will relate to the central theme of protein structure and function and be collaborative in nature with pairs of students working on different aspects of a specific project guided by faculty from the three disciplines. The program's recruitment effort consists of traditional mailings, digital-based advertising, and campus visits. Preference will be given to students with a GPA of 3.0 or higher and who have completed either an organic chemistry or biochemistry course. Students are selected based on academic record, research interest, and potential for outstanding research in the biosciences. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool.
