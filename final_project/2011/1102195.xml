    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the research is to develop fully autonomous Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system&lt;br/&gt;consisting of sensors organically integrated within the structure, free of wire leads and external power sources. Central to the proposed approach are the multi-functional piezoelectric transducer-based smart aggregates, which can transform ambient energy to electricity power, modulate useful information on stress waves for communication, and generate and receive stress waves for detection of structural defects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectually, the project will advance the knowledge regarding communication over concrete conduits&lt;br/&gt;through: i) Measurement-driven characterization of SA transceivers and concrete channels under different&lt;br/&gt;loading conditions, and ii) Design of modulation schemes for acoustic communications in concrete channels. The project aims to develop a holistic system solution through: i) the development of energy harvesting and storage modules, in conjunction with low-power circuits, and ii) Design and evaluation of energy-aware task&lt;br/&gt;scheduling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is expected to generate far-reaching broader impacts in science, education, and&lt;br/&gt;society. Our systems-based research integrates innovative research on hardware, algorithms, and&lt;br/&gt;architectures to enable the next generation of cyber systems. It also integrates educational activities in real-life infrastructure building, communications systems, and networking. In the near term, the basic building blocks developed for communication and energy harvesting can help extend existing wireless-based,&lt;br/&gt;battery powered systems, making these systems more fault tolerant and energy efficient. In the long term,&lt;br/&gt;the project outcomes can provide impetus for wide-spread integration of fully autonomous SHM systems as&lt;br/&gt;the technology matures, leading to improved public safety and reduced maintenance costs.</AbstractNarration>
