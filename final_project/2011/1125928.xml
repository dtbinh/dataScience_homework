    <AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation proposal requests funds to acquire a Bruker D8 Discover X-Ray Diffraction system that will serve the crystallographic characterization needs of the Brown research community. The instrument will be used for phase identification, single crystal orientation, grazing incidence diffraction, and reflectometry, and will enable a variety of ongoing research efforts in engineering, physics, chemistry, geology, biology and medicine, and the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World. The relevant project portfolio includes work on conducting oxides, Pb-free solders, high-strength steels, magnetic materials, composites, Li-ion battery anodes, natural rock textures, new graphenic carbon structures, archeological samples, and newly synthesized nanomaterials for which sample volumes are limited and high XRD sensitivity is needed. The instrument will be also integrated into crystallography laboratory exercises for undergraduate instruction, and will be used in existing K-12 outreach programs that involve student groups from local stressed urban districts, in which students participate in age-appropriate learning modules. The instrument will be housed in the Brown University X-ray Facility, which will be operated and administratively managed as a cost-center within the Brown Institute for Molecular and Nanoscale Innovation, which promotes nanoscience and materials science research and education across the Brown campus and also coordinates outreach to local industry, government, and educational institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation proposal requests funds to acquire an X-Ray Diffractometer to study the atomic structure and properties of solid materials. This technique is an essential work-horse tool in the development of new materials for applications that range from lightweight vehicles, to batteries for renewable energy storage, to non-toxic lead-free solders, to magnetic hard drives and memories. The new instrument will also be employed at Brown for the study of natural rock textures in geological and planetary studies, for the examination and analysis of archeological samples, and for the development of new ultrafine materials made using the tools of nanotechnology. The XRD instrument will enable a wide variety of ongoing research efforts at Brown in programs that include engineering, physics, chemistry, geology, biology and medicine, and the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World. The instrument will also be integrated into laboratory exercises for undergraduate instruction, and will be used in existing K-12 outreach programs that involve student groups from local stressed urban districts, in which students participate in age-appropriate learning modules.
