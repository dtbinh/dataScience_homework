    <AbstractNarration>PI: Manglik&lt;br/&gt;CBET-1153397&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this workshop/conference award is to bring together U.S and Indian scientists and researchers working in the field of heat and mass transfer and to foster and promote collaborations. The workshops will be held in the December 2011 to January 2012 timeframe and will be centered around the 10th ISHMT ASME Heat and Mass Transfer Conference at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India (Dec 27-29, 2011).&lt;br/&gt;Five workshops are being planned that will be located in Chennai (the conference site) or nearby (or easily accessible) city to deal with the following emerging areas with significant current research thrust in both countries:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Thermal Design &amp; Management in Electronics&lt;br/&gt;- Heat &amp; Mass Transfer in Biological Systems&lt;br/&gt;- High-Performance Heat Exchange Systems for Energy Sustainability&lt;br/&gt;- Advances in Fuel Cell Engineering&lt;br/&gt;- Advances in Energy, Combustion and Transportation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the premier venue for disseminating research findings for India's thermal sciences and engineering community and the workshops located around the conference will attract participants from research organizations (academia, industrial centers, and national labs) all over India. Also, US delegates will have the opportunities to meet and interact with researchers from many other Asian countries who generally do not attend technical meetings in Europe and the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, there is strong interest between the two countries both politically ansd scientifically to promote collaborations. These workshops centered around the ASME-ISHMT meeting will facilitate the researchers in the two countries to collaborate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will address fundamental and emerging areas in heat and mass transfer and will enhance US-India cooperation on future thermal technologies, share informatin, build institutional bridges, and promote educational and cross-cultural experiences for all participants. The US delegation will be a diverse group and include beginning and established researchers, women, under-represented and early-career faculty members. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since strong research collaborations are developed through sustained interactions, and periodic discussions and refreshment of ideas, the proposed visit will strengthen current and ongoing collaborations and discussiions, and will enhance successes achieved through prior workshops and collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
