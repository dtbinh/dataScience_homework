    <AbstractNarration>SES - 1131019&lt;br/&gt;Rory McVeigh (PI)&lt;br/&gt;Austin Choi-Fitzpatrick (co-PI)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral Dissertation Research: How Human Rights Interventions Affect Local Norms and Practices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slavery is often viewed as a purely historical phenomenon when, in fact, contemporary slavery remains widespread. Contemporary slaveholders find themselves in the unique position of exercising social control rather than legal ownership. With few exceptions, the role of slaveholders has gone largely unexplored. Focusing on contemporary slavery in India as a case in point, this project addresses the following question: How do human rights interventions generate different social conditions and relations that, in turn, may affect the attitudes and behaviors of former slaveholders? The research design relies on data generated by 100 interviews conducted in Uttar Pradesh, India. This research project seeks to make a contribution to the literature regarding international organizations, social movements, and human rights. Findings will also inform current theoretical debates on the role of elites in social movements, as well as policy debates over the form and function of contemporary emancipation practices. Specifically, the project examine the degree to which human rights interventions, including those encouraging former slaves to challenge authority openly, result in resistance from elites as well as the development of new forms of oppression patterned along prior, e.g., group-based norms and hierarchies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, contemporary slavery has received significant attention in international forums and the media. How to curb the practice most effectively remains hotly contested. At issue is the effectiveness of a range of conflicting strategies designed to facilitate long-term emancipation, from community organizing to raid and rescue interventions. Findings from this study may inform our understanding of how to facilitate emancipation and reduce the incidence of contemporary slavery around the world. Findings may also inform policymakers, academics and advocates.</AbstractNarration>
