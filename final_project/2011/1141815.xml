    <AbstractNarration>The main objective of this EArly Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) research project is to fabricate an artificial photosynthesis device that is capable of converting sunlight, CO2 and water into sugars for the production of biofuels. Solid freeform fabrication (SFF) enhanced by high-resolution heterogeneous printing technology will be investigated to design and build the innovative device with multi-layer interconnected channels and micro-porous structures. This research will enable manufacturing and deployment of large-scale solar conversion systems that not only mimic the nature process of photosynthesis for the production of biofuels, but also make these reactions independent of the life of nature plants. An interdisciplinary research team has been formed, synergistically combining the expertise of two investigators from Drexel University and Kansas State University in solid freeform fabrication, system design and control, biomaterials, biofuels and molecular biology. The U.S. government aims to replace 20 percent (51 billion gasoline-equivalent gallons) of fossil-based transportation fuels with biofuels by the year 2030. Producing this amount of biofuel would require an unsustainably large cropping area when using any bio-based sources (biomass) that are currently available. As an alternative technology, artificial photosynthesis can produce tremendous amounts of clean and renewable biofuels because of its extremely high solar conversion efficiency and carbon neutral nature. However, lacking commercially available artificial photosynthesis devices, there is a big gap between lab-scale artificial photosynthesis technologies and in-field applications. This project will research a new manufacturing system and method to first-time fabricate a leaf-tree-like artificial photosynthesis device. This research will be the first of its kind in solid freeform fabrication of artificial photosynthesis device integrated with polymers and protein/enzyme. Knowledge obtained from this study will guide design of structures and determination of manufacturing methods of the artificial photosynthesis device, which will eventually lead to large-scale use of commercially deployable constructs for biofuel manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this research will lead to a new technology for designing and manufacturing an artificial photosynthesis device, which will help realize the vision of affordable bio-based energy manufacturing. Economically viable manufacturing of biofuels will greatly benefit the U.S. economy and energy security, as well as society and the environment in general. Success of the proposed activities will help expand the role of the manufacturing research community to create a new, trillion dollar energy manufacturing industry in the United States. Two doctoral students will be trained and three project-based learning modules will be created to strengthen the undergraduate engineering curricula, engaging students with design projects in design, manufacturing and energy engineering.</AbstractNarration>
