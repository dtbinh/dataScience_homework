    <AbstractNarration>1111477&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Andrew D Robertson&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Keystone Symposia on Molecular and Cellular Biology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial support for travel of US participants to participate in Keystone Symposia meeting on Biofuels, to be held in Singapore, March 1-6, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of the Keystone Symposia meeting on Biofuels is to make a meaningful contribution to reducing dependence on fossil feedstocks by creating secure and sustainable sources for fuel, power, and products. The 2011 Keystone biofuels symposium will serve as a venue to highlight advances in biofuels research from three major biomass feedstocks: lignocellulosic plant material, algae, and alternative feedstocks such as Jatropha. This symposium will bring together plant and algae biologists engaged in biofuels research from academia, industry and government. The long term goal is to facilitate collaborations intended to accelerate the accumulation of basic knowledge of photosynthetic organisms, both algae and plants, and to accelerate the deployment of new and expanded bioenergy feedstocks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will also provide educational benefits. Specifically, symposium activities are designed to acquaint trainees and investigators new to the field of bioenergy crop research with the state-of-the-art developments in this area through oral presentations and poster sessions, and to provide these new investigators with opportunities for feedback, networking and mentorship from senior colleagues.</AbstractNarration>
