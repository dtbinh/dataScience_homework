    <AbstractNarration>The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD), an NSA/DHS Center for Excellence in Education and Research, is creating a capacity building program in assured cloud computing. This project leverages the 2010 NSF Scholarship for Service (SFS) award, which is developing strong educational, research and system building activities in information assurance (IA). UTD offers courses at both the graduate and undergraduate levels in IA. This project is developing courses in assured cloud computing as well as enhancing existing courses on Systems Security, Network Security, Data and Applications Security, Data Mining for Security Applications and Digital Forensics through the introduction of a major component in cloud computing for each of these courses. The project is also enhancing the current secure cloud computing framework so that students can use this framework for their course projects and build features for the framework as part of their class programming projects. The courses are available to members of the academic, government and industrial communities. UTD has strong relationships with minority groups through education grants from agencies such as NSF (GK-12) and the Department of Education (GAANN). The project is actively recruiting students from underrepresented groups to participate in courses and activities in assured cloud computing. As part of the project, the PIs are teaching cyber security courses at a Texas minority-serving institution.</AbstractNarration>
