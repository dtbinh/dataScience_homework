    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program, Prof. Thomas Lectka of Johns Hopkins University develops new chemical methods that employ several independent catalysts working synergistically to produce chemically interesting and useful products not easily accessible in other ways. Besides theoretical interest, operational simplicity, low catalyst loadings, mutual compatibility, and broad scope will be fundamental goals as well. The foundation of the approach will be polycomponent catalysis (for example, a catalytic nucleophile in combination with an organometallic complex, a Lewis acid, and/or a phase transfer catalyst) that results in powerful methods for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant functionalized targets, including chiral fluorides, alkaloids, lactams and related compounds. A focus on new methods of fluorination is especially noted; fluorinated organic molecules provide fruitful and exciting new leads for drug discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project would serve three main goals: 1) the development of complex yet highly worthwhile new chemical processes; 2) fundamentally new approaches to the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant targets and other useful molecules; 3) and practical training in synthetic chemistry for graduate students (including members of underrepresented groups). Equally, exposure of numerous undergraduates to synthetic projects (especially at hospital-oriented Johns Hopkins) will help to prepare them for careers in health-related occupations.</AbstractNarration>
