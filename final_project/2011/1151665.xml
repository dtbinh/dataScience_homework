    <AbstractNarration>The CAREER Award by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division supports research and educational activities of Professor Valerie C. Pierre of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities to develop and promulgate novel luminescent sensors for the study of alkali ions in neurons. The approach employs coordination chemistry and the unique photophysical properties of lanthanide complexes as components in a predictive design strategy in the development of new sensors for group I ions, and the application of these sensors in cellular imaging. The ultimate goal is to produce new tools enabling the simultaneous and selective spatio-temporal imaging of multiple alkali cations in tissues. This work advances the field of lanthanide chemistry by investigating the electronic and geometric requirements of their sensitized luminescence, and the field of molecular recognition by investigating novel binding modes. The program involves graduate and undergraduate students, including underrepresented minorities, in interdisciplinary research and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational activities are to promote science and research to undergraduate students, both from University of Minnesota and nearby community colleges, early in their career while nurturing their scientific creativity and instilling a solid foundation of research methodology via the creation of a series of workshops. During the semester, a small group of sophomore and junior undergraduate chemistry majors will be mentored into developing their own research project which they will subsequently perform in research groups in the Department. Students working in the group of Professor Pierre are expected to present their research to the broader scientific community through participation in regional and national meetings, and to publish results in widely circulated and respected journals.</AbstractNarration>
