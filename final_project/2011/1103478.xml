    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to generate a Uranium/Thorium (U/Th) dated record of rainfall in the southern tropical Pacific at sub-century (~50 year/sample) resolution for most of the glacial and Holocene periods using stalagmites from the island of Niue and from Tonga. The speleothem from Niue dates to 83,000 years before the present. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the researchers will: 1) analyze the Niue specimen, as well as a Holocene-age stalagmite from Tonga, for Oxygen-18, Carbon-13, Magnesium/Calcium ratios, Strontium/Calcium ratios, and Barium/Calcium ratios; 2) generate a precise absolute-dated U/Th age model for the specimens; and 3) undertake drip-water sampling to validate paleoclimate interpretations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to examine the following hypotheses: a) at times of increased Thermohaline Circulation (THC), a northward shift of the Pacific Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) dominated over a westward shift in the Walker Cell resulting in decreased rainfall at Niue; and b) rainfall records at Niue will show rapid shifts in phase with Greenland ice-core records, but will also show additional changes characteristic of Antarctic temperature records.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include the potential for a high-quality paleoclimate record from an important and under-studied region. In addition to the scientific importance and support of a graduate student, the researcher will conduct outreach through a NSF-sponsored program through which high-school students and teachers from New Jersey participate in workshops on marine and climate science.</AbstractNarration>
