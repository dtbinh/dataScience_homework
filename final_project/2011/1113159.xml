    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in developing novel high-power, high-efficiency Deep Ultraviolet Light Emitting Diode (DUV LED) Lamps based on an innovative and new micro-pixel device design. Deep ultraviolet light sources with emission wavelengths lambda from 250 - 365 nm are used in many applications including water/air purification, analytical scientific instrumentation, bio-agent detection systems and emerging miniaturized bio-medical instrumentation. Aluminum-indium-gallium-nitride (AlInGaN) based DUVLEDs have recently been developed and commercialized. However at present their external quantum efficiency and output powers are only 1-2% and 1-2 mW in continuous operating mode. One of the primary causes of these low numbers is current crowding arising from the resistance of the n-AlGaN buffer layers. To address this challenge large area LEDs with micro-pixel device geometry with expected output powers of 15-20mW and a stable operation with lifetime over 3000 hours are being developed. New approaches are being developed for the n-AlGaN buffer layers and the active layers deposition to increase their thickness, avoid cracking, and reduce their resistance and defects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project represents a new opportunity for developing semiconductor materials based solid-state deep ultraviolet light sources. The targeted performance will allow for penetration into large existing UV market segments such as water purification, medical instrumentation and UV polymer curing. The deep ultraviolet optoelectronic field continues to grow each year and the expertise gained through this program will contribute to the advancement of novel DUV light sources. The project will also lead to jobs for graduates from local Universities and Technical Institutes thereby fostering high-tech economic development in the state of South Carolina. Moreover the project will significantly enhance the knowledge base in high-aluminum content AlInGaN materials science, their epitaxial deposition and processing and packaging. There is a very high probability of transitioning the knowledge base and the developed technology to commercial products for disinfection/purification and polymer curing markets.</AbstractNarration>
