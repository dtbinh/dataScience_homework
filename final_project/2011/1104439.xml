    <AbstractNarration>This U.S.- Chile visit proposal will support one senior researcher, one graduate student, and one undergraduate from Arizona State University, under the direction of Dr. Jesus R. Villalobos, on two visits to Chile during 2011. The primary goal of these visits is to refine collaborations on the development of a research framework for international supply chains of perishable commodities between investigators from Arizona State University and the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso in Chile (PUCV). The PI and the visiting students will participate in work sessions with Drs. Rosa Guadalupe Gonzalez Ramirez, Pablo Miranda Gonzalez, and José Ceroni Díaz, from The Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, all with strong expertise in Port Operations and Management. The students will extend or compare their current research approaches to include considerations of Chilean ports and supply chains. The impact of port service variability is especially important in the supply chains for perishable commodities, which are of great importance in the commerce between Chile and the United States. One of the main objectives of these visits is to set the analytical framework to incorporate perishability into supply chain decision. In particular, the research team plan to develop a methodology for the design of port operations that will best serve the shippers of these types of commodities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaboration will be a catalyst for regional commercial development and will form an initial core of US and Chilean researchers that will expand to researchers from other Latin American countries over time. Additionally, the proposed activities will strengthen the material of undergraduate and graduate courses that address theoretical and practical issues in port logistics, and supply chain planning and management. It is believed that the resulting collaboration will also increase the number of students obtaining advanced degrees in logistics. This award is supported by the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships of the Directorate of Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
