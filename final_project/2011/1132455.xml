    <AbstractNarration>Vikas Tomar &lt;br/&gt;OISE- 1132455 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S.-India Planning Visit: Catalyzing Collaboration on the Mechanics of Materials in Extreme Environments &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning visit will initiate collaborative research in mechanical engineering between Purdue University Professor Vikas Tomar, School of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM) Professor Srikanth Vedantam, Department of Engineering Design. The focus of the research is to develop a modeling based approach to predicting high temperature material (HTM) microstructure evolution and its effect on material strength in high temperature environments. The PI and graduate student will undertake a two-week visit to India's premier IITM in Chennai to finalize preliminary calculations at the Indian facility in preparation for submitting a research proposal to either CMMI's Materials and Surface Engineering Program or DMR's Materials World Network Program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research- microstructural development in high temperature materials- is a challenging and fundamental problem in materials science that could have broad impact on many areas in the materials sciences. Successful completion of the research has potential to lead to new HTMs with sustained strength in high temperature environments. Beyond this, the goal is to develop a predictive framework and formation of scientific principles that will transform the science of material microstructure prediction for sustained HTM strength in extreme environments. The inclusion of a US graduate student in this planning visit offers a unique opportunity to conduct research with international investigators and contributes to the sustainability of collaboration between Purdue and the IITM in Chennai, India.</AbstractNarration>
