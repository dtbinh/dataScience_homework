    <AbstractNarration>This award funds research in economic theory that develops methods for incorporating behavioral ideas about individual preferences into formal mechanism design models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanism design is a formal framework for analyzing the design and operation of social and economic institutions. It is a central tool in microeconomic theory applied in contexts as varied as organizational design, personnel management, auctions, matching markets etc. A cornerstone of mechanism design theory is the analysis of incentives and how institutions are designed to manage them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Behavioral economics has identified a number of important deviations from standard theories of individual behavior and researchers have begun to revisit mechanism design problems in their presence. A theoretical hurdle exists because many of these theories give rise to preferences under which the standard tools for characterizing the constraints imposed by incentives no longer apply. In this project the PI is investigating a generalization of the classical revenue equivalence property and accompanying analytical techniques. Applying these techniques allows the PI and future researchers to study how behavioral assumptions alter the normative and positive theories of institution design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; An important behavioral finding is loss aversion. Losses relative to a reference level of consumption are amplified by comparison to gains. This is a finding that is documented at the level of individual behavior and the next step for research is to understand its impact on markets. In this project the PI reformulates a classical problem of monopoly price discrimination to investigate how a seller leverages a buyers' loss aversion in order to increase profits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methodology developed here can also be applied to develop new insights into the design of auctions, insurance, and other contracts. Finally, a related behavioral phenomenon, inequality aversion, lends itself to a similar analysis. Conflict resolution, contract settlement, and other bargaining protocols can be analyzed from mechanism design standpoint when the affected agents have preferences that respond to inequality.</AbstractNarration>
