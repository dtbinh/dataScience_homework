    <AbstractNarration>Corrosion of metals in aqueous environments is an area of great economic, environmental and technological importance. Prevention of corrosion is a key component of sustainability programs, since it helps avoid costly replacements, limits consumption of valuable resources, and controls the spread of environmental contaminants. It is becoming increasingly possible to understand materials corrosion issues at the atomic/molecular level, and to use theoretical approaches in the design of corrosion resistant materials and protection systems. The next few years promise to be particularly scientifically exciting and this meeting is the ideal forum within which to generate and nurture that enthusiasm. This Gordon Research Conference and the preceding Gordon Research Seminar will foster interdisciplinary scientific interactions by convening a group of distinguished researchers and young scientists to discuss a diverse range of materials science and corrosion issues. Oral presentations will cover the range from perennial issues to those that probe the interfaces between corrosion science and related scientific disciplines. Discussion of recent advances covering the atomistic and macroscale levels will be promoted, and a strong emphasis will be placed on the linkages between experimental, computational modeling and theoretical approaches. The GRC-GRS combination provides an essential forum to bring together experts and young scientists in an atmosphere designed to facilitate extensive discussion and the dissemination of new knowledge and understanding. Funding will be used to defray the expenses of invited GRS speakers and to support the attendance of underrepresented minorities and other worthy participants, including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, who would otherwise not be able to attend.</AbstractNarration>
