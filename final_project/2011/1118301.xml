    <AbstractNarration>1118301&lt;br/&gt;Bayazitolu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An international symposium entitled Thermal and Materials Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (TMNN-2011) will be held on May 29- June 3, 2011 in Antalya, Turkey. It is envisioned to have around 150 attendees. This proposal to NSF requests funds for eight graduate and postdoctoral students and eight key leaders who will be attending the symposium and are experts on this proposed emerging area of research and engineering. Emphasis is being given to solicit participation from minority and underrepresented groups. Each invitee will be expected to participate fully and to submit a contributed paper to the symposium. Some will be asked to be the panelists. The invited participant will receive partial travel support, which will cover a portion of the estimated symposium travel expenses. The symposium will host a special graduate and postdoctoral student co-authored poster session which will be identified and marked as "Sponsored by NSF". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will explore potential advancements in the field of thermal and materials engineering enabled by nanoscience and nanotechnology. It will play a role in bridging the gap between chemistry, physics and engineering. It will contribute to the goal of further understanding the wide diversity of length scales ranging from the nano- to macroscopic scales. It will provide a unique platform for researchers, high tech industry practitioners and educators engaged and interested in nanoscience and nanotechnology to identify significant challenges and opportunities in solving thermal and materials problems. The panel discussions will help to identify short and long term research areas for collaborations between the thermal and materials science groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium will offer an opportunity to establish international relationship and collaboration. The scientific and engineering education and training needs related to thermal and material science applications of nanotechnology are critical components of the symposium. It will give opportunity to the graduate students to be leaders in organizing/participating in technical sessions. The symposium organizers will ensure a diverse representation of attendees would be present, including underrepresented groups, females, students and young professionals. The workshop proceedings and the special journal issue will be broadly disseminated through various channels.</AbstractNarration>
