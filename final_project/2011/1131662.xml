    <AbstractNarration>This award provides student support for the Twenty-Second International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium to be held August 8-10, 2011 in Austin, Texas. The meeting is comprised of plenary and parallel session technical presentations and a poster session. There is ample time allotted for informal interactions of world-class researchers and students in formal meeting settings and also at informal social events during the meeting. Approximately 150 persons will attend, with approximately 50 of these participants being students. The two "FAME" awards will be given for the third time. The first is a senior award called the "Freeform and Additive Manufacturing Excellence" (FAME) Award. The second is an award to recognize researchers early in their career, the Award for "Outstanding Young Research in Freeform and Additive Manufacturing". There will also be a special session on sustainability and additive manufacturing. The conference will bring together world experts in the area to update and extend their understanding of advances in the technology. All meeting papers will be published in a conference proceedings to be distributed to all participants including students. The award will support approximately 50 students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is a mechanism for transfer and dissemination of knowledge and understanding in the field of additive, freeform manufacturing. It is a model for advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning. The networking of world-class researchers with students is strong. The meeting is a pinion for research infrastructure. Through the heavily cited proceedings, information is widely disseminated to an extensive network of researchers and students around the world. The societal impact includes identification of pre-commercial technologies and sharing of information pertaining to freeform fabrication that will eventually be developed and implemented into machines and processes that will enhance domestic productivity.</AbstractNarration>
