    <AbstractNarration>1123512&lt;br/&gt;Levine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place during April 16-25, 2012 at the Universidad de la Rep√∫blica and the Institut Pasteur in Montevideo, Uruguay. Organized by Dr. Michael S. Levine and Dr. Ida Chow from the Society for Developmental Biology (SDB) in Bethesda, Maryland, the institute will focus on a systems biology approach to understand the mechanisms of organismal evolution. This PASI is part of a collaborative program between the SDB and the Latin American Society for Developmental Biology (LASDB) to train junior scientists on integrating bioinformatics and systems biology approaches with traditional experimentation to further our understanding of evolutionary processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increased sophistication of computational methods, whole-genome analysis, and high-resolution imaging technologies provide concrete opportunities for cross-disciplinary approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of Darwinian evolution. Using these cutting edge tools and innovative approaches on different model and indigenous organisms, this PASI will contribute to the training of future scientists in the Americas. Participants with different backgrounds?from computer and mathematical sciences to biology and chemistry?who are interested in evolutionary biology will be considered and the most qualified will be selected, with care to maintain diversity on training, research themes and background within the student population. Participants will stay on (April 26-29) to attend the 6th International Meeting of the LASDB, where they will be able to present their own work to a larger international audience.</AbstractNarration>
