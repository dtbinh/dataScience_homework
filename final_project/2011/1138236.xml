    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this NUE in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Integrative Biomedical Nanotechnology Laboratory Course", at the Ohio State University (OSU), under the direction of Dr. Yi Zhao, is to develop a laboratory course for biomedical engineering undergraduates which synergistically integrates discrete pieces of nanotechnology education in traditional engineering disciplines and offers hands-on experience to students in this highly multidisciplinary field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the immediate benefits to biomedical engineering undergraduates at OSU, the outcome of this educational development will be applicable to a wider public audience. Dissemination to other BME educators will be through Big 10 BME exchange talk, educational conferences, publications in educational journals and global educational collaborations. The laboratory course emphasizing connections between hands-on experience and fundamental knowledge/principles of nanotechnology will provide a paradigm for undergraduate education in other multidisciplinary fields. Moreover, the dissemination to K-12 students will be implemented through the established Engineers in Motion program where grade appropriate versions of the experimental modules will be designed to match the educational background of the K-12 students involved. The proposed integrative biomedical nanotechnology laboratory course is expected to enhance work force development and create new opportunities for biomedical engineering undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
