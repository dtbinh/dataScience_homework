    <AbstractNarration>Voice conversion (VC) systems transform segments of speech from a given source speaker so that it&lt;br/&gt;can be identified as spoken by a specified target speaker. Currently, standard VC systems require&lt;br/&gt;parallel training on extensively labeled sets of speech data where the source and target speaker share&lt;br/&gt;equivalent content for building direct mapping models. This project builds on the concepts of nonparallel&lt;br/&gt;VC systems reducing the need for labeled and shared speech content between source and target&lt;br/&gt;speakers as well as allowing for both intra-lingual and cross-lingual conversion scenarios. This project&lt;br/&gt;focuses on two main areas: (1) Building a framework for non-parallel VC without explicit phonetic,&lt;br/&gt;sound, word, or sentence level labels, and (2) Providing effective target speaker mapping to obtain&lt;br/&gt;converted speech with as good as or better quality compared to current VC systems. The VC&lt;br/&gt;framework consists of three main components: (1) A speaker independent language model; (2) An&lt;br/&gt;algorithm for model adaptation to target speaker; (3) A speech synthesis block to generate converted&lt;br/&gt;speech from a target-adapted language model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a broad framework for applications such as personalization of assistive textto-&lt;br/&gt;speech (TTS) systems, foreign language learning, and as a possible component in speech-to-speech&lt;br/&gt;translation systems. This project will support graduate student research and provide results for&lt;br/&gt;community distribution through conference and journal submission. Additionally, an open-source&lt;br/&gt;software toolset will be developed and freely distributed. The project will also be used in outreach for&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
