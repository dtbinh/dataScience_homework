    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing a partnership with the local community college, community leaders and industry to enhance existing training programs. Specifically Mechatronics and Innovation training is being provided to rural students and technicians. The project fulfills a local industrial need and could serve as a national model for delivering advanced technology education in rural areas. Because of its rural setting and focus on secondary and industry programs, the project serves students from underrepresented groups better than many other programs. In addition to increasing the number of graduates ready for employment and trained in Mechatronics, the project is developing graduates with entrepreneurial skills. Entrepreneurial skills are helping build the local economy and providing graduates more opportunities nationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses proven delivery methods and emphasizes technician education relevancy so students are fully engaged. Engagement will increase student recruitment, retention and graduation numbers. Through the project partnership, articulation between secondary schools and the community college is being enhanced which will also lead to improved student success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also provides professional development opportunities for secondary and post-secondary faculty. Faculty development is expected to make it easier to integrate new curriculum materials into existing courses thereby creating a sustainable program.</AbstractNarration>
