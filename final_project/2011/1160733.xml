    <AbstractNarration>During development, a single cell divides and differentiates to become a complete multicellular organism. Understanding normal development is essential to understanding both developmental defects and cancers, in which developmental programs have been reactivated resulting in uncontrolled growth and metastasis. Amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) is proving an excellent model for development as it is closely related to vertebrates but much simpler both structurally and genomically. The amphioxus genome is fully sequenced and there are extensive libraries of clones of genes expressed in development. Thus, identifying developmental genes and gene networks is proving to be easier in amphioxus than in vertebrate model organisms. Despite these advantages, amphioxus is not widely studied because embryos have only been available during a limited breeding season. The present study builds upon recent breakthroughs in amphioxus husbandry to establish protocols for the continuous culture of amphioxus in the laboratory as well as methods for genetically manipulating amphioxus to determine gene functions. Successful laboratory culture of amphioxus will allow genetic lines of amphioxus to be established, as has been done for such vertebrate models as the mouse and zebrafish, but at lower cost. Thus, the project will open up new avenues for rapidly and economically solving basic developmental processes. All methods and resources developed will be made publically available. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings. The work will also provide unique educational opportunities for a graduate student, two undergraduates, and 1-2 high school students per year. Finally, the project will strengthen international collaborations between research laboratories in the U.S. and Taiwan, establish a new web resource for the developmental biology community, and be incorporated into educational outreach activities through the Birch Aquarium in San Diego and the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History.
