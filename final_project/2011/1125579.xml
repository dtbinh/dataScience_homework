    <AbstractNarration>The recent discovery on Oct. 14, 2010, of exceptionally preserved plant and large mammal fossils at&lt;br/&gt;Zeigler Reservoir near Snowmass Village, Colorado provides a brief opportunity to study an amazingly&lt;br/&gt;well-preserved, sequence of high-elevation Ice Age ecosystems. In 18 days (Oct. 29 to Nov. 17, 2010),&lt;br/&gt;the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science (DMNS) excavated more than 600 bones comprising parts of 8-&lt;br/&gt;10 American mastodons, 4 Columbian mammoths, 4 Ice Age bison, 2 deer, 1 Jefferson?s ground sloth&lt;br/&gt;(the first record in Colorado and the highest altitude record in North America), multiple Tiger&lt;br/&gt;salamanders, and exceptionally preserved plant, insect and aquatic invertebrate fossils. As a whole, the&lt;br/&gt;site represents the first relatively complete sequence of lacustrine Pleistocene ecosystems at high&lt;br/&gt;elevation in the Rocky Mountains. A number of key research questions and opportunities have emerged:&lt;br/&gt;1) What does this site tell us about high elevation Pleistocene climate and biota in the Ice Age Rockies?&lt;br/&gt;2) What is the geochronology of the site? 3) What is the detailed history of lake in-filling? 4) What were&lt;br/&gt;the life histories of the site?s mammoths and mastodons? 5) Given the large number of specimens, can we&lt;br/&gt;undertake metapopulation analyses of the bison, mammoth, and mastodon? And 6) what is the relevance&lt;br/&gt;of this Rocky Mountain climate and biotic record to present-day issues of climate change?&lt;br/&gt;To answer these over-arching questions and other more specific questions, we have assembled a team of&lt;br/&gt;32 scientists from 15 institutions organized into six groups to undertake a comprehensive multidisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;study of the Ziegler Reservoir fossil lake. These groups are: 1) regional and local geology; 2)&lt;br/&gt;stratigraphy; 3) geochronology; 4) fossil vertebrates; 5) fossil plants; and 6) fossil invertebrates. Using&lt;br/&gt;this approach, we are designing a plan to: 1) excavate the remaining fossil resources from the dam site in&lt;br/&gt;May-June, 2011, before the site is buried by planned dam construction in July-September; 2) implement a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive scientific research plan to study and understand this site; 3) preserve and conserve the&lt;br/&gt;fossils from the site; and 4) to use the results of this discovery provide world-class educational&lt;br/&gt;opportunities to local, regional, national, and international audiences. DMNS is planning an&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive media and documentary plan for the 2011 excavation and DMNS educators will return to&lt;br/&gt;the Roaring Fork Valley in Spring 2011 to provide free education programs for K-12 students in all of the&lt;br/&gt;Roaring Fork Valley schools, including in-school assembly programs, distance learning programs, teacher&lt;br/&gt;professional development programs, and early childhood education resources available on&lt;br/&gt;www.dmns.org. This grant will partially fund the fieldwork portion of 2011 activities.</AbstractNarration>
