    <AbstractNarration>The 2011 International Conference on Thermochemical Biomass Conversion Science (tcbiomass2011) is an academic and industry conference to exchange the latest research and development data from around the world in thermochemical conversion of biomass to fuels, chemicals and power. Thermochemical conversion holds great promise for the production of biomass-derived fuels for renewable, sustainable energy. Tcbiomass2011 is a global forum that focuses on this important area of science that will help accelerate the commercial realization of technology related to clean energy. The conference focuses on bringing experts together, sharing experiences and advancing solutions for thermochemical bioenergy production. Foremost experts in the fields of &lt;br/&gt;gasification, pretreatment, pyrolysis, and upgrading will provide a program that will present the latest research and deployment results. These meaningful collaborations will lead to increase the contribution of bioenergy to economic and energy growth, security, and sustainability. Gas Technology Institute is organizing the tcbiomass2011 conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF funding would support the reduced student registration rate that is $400 below the delegate registration rate. At this time, 27 graduate students representing 11 different institutions have registered for the conference, and more are expected. By exposing students to research presentations and the opportunity to network with top industry experts, the conference will encourage more people to choose biomass as an area for study. This is an educational event that many of these students might not be able to attend without NSF support.</AbstractNarration>
