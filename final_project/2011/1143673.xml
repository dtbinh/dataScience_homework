    <AbstractNarration>The 19th Particles and Nuclei International Conference (PANIC) will be held at MIT in Cambridge, MA, on July 24-29, 2011. This major triennial international conference showcases the most significant developments of interest to both the nuclear and particle physics communities and is expected to attract about 600 attendees. In addition, 2011 will be the centennial of the discovery of the atomic nucleus by Rutherford and it is planned to make the celebration of this seminal event a major theme of the meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will enable extended participation to interested people who would not otherwise be able to attend, through 1) video recording and online distribution of the plenary sessions so that scientists from all over the world can participate, 2) video recording and website access of the pedagogical lecture session on the Sunday before the official conference begins, aimed at advanced undergraduates and graduate students just beginning their research, 3) video recording and online distribution of the public lectures by Profs. Brian Cathcart and Jerome Friedman, and 4) providing support for an MIT Undergraduate Research Opportunities student to help with a limited program to high school physics teachers and students.</AbstractNarration>
