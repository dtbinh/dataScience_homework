    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Observational astronomy exercises are essential in the undergraduate introductory astronomy laboratories. But, to engage in real observational astronomy, students need access to computerized telescopes equipped with electronic detectors (CCD cameras, etc.). Additionally, students and instructors need access to the processing tools and technical expertise required to perform the data analysis. If a significant fraction of institutions are to implement observational labs, there must be a way to share access to existing resources. The growing number of available Internet accessible robotic observatories are the answer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is to develop flexible inquiry-based laboratory curricula and easy-to-use data processing tools that allow any institution, regardless of available local equipment and on-site expertise, to easily integrate real observational astronomy exercises into their introductory astronomy courses. A consortium of six institutions within the Minneapolis-St. Paul area is developing, testing, and implementing a set of observational labs, associated data processing tools, and supporting materials for use on the University of St. Thomas (UST) Physics Department robotic observatory. Following testing at the UST Observatory, the consortium is purchasing observing time from Global-Rent-A-Scope, a commercial enterprise that sells observing time on telescopes at dark sites, and modifying and testing the materials for use on their systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Nearly every undergraduate institution offers an introductory astronomy course for nontechnical majors. These courses involve an enormous number of students who have little additional contact with scientific thought in their college careers. This project directly addresses the need for access to high quality observational equipment by institutions lacking the resources to purchase and maintain their own. This project impacts students, staff, and faculty at institutions of all levels. The consortium was selected specifically to represent a full spectrum of institutions that could benefit from this work. They include two community colleges (North Hennepin and Normandale), a state university (Metro State), a liberal arts university (The University of St. Thomas), an R1 institution (The University of Minnesota), and a high school (Cretin-Derham Hall) that have participated in developing a pilot of this project.</AbstractNarration>
