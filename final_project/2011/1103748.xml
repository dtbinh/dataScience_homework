    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing a comprehensive strategic plan for the design of a regional Agriculture Education and Technology Center (AETC) to develop and disseminate science, technology and pedagogical resources for secondary and post-secondary educators. Current work with faculty in post-secondary agriculture education programs throughout California is being leveraged for this project. Programs in five neighboring states (Nevada, Arizona, Oregon, Idaho, and Washington) are being explored to determine the geographic area that will best be served by a regional agriculture center on the West Coast. The project is: 1) Assessing the strengths and needs of community college and university agriculture education programs in delivering pre-service and in-service preparation for agriculture teachers within the region; 2) Developing plans for core center activities that support agriculture programs and agriculture science and technology instructors; and 3) Developing a research agenda for agriculture graduate students to conduct in-depth studies of issues pertinent to agriculture educators. Special attention is given to pedagogy and support for students, including minorities, who have not typically pursued Agriculture Education as a career. Finally, the essential community college link between high school and university education is strengthened through the creation of a collaborative, centralized regional center.</AbstractNarration>
