    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop an on-line analyzer to enable the increased use of alternative fuels in cement manufacturing, and thus reduce energy costs. Cement manufacturing is highly energy-intensive, accounting for a significant portion of fuel use in the world. The rising cost of energy has motivated cement manufacturers to use alternative fuels available at low or no cost (e.g., tires, municipal waste etc.). However, the use of alternative fuels creates manufacturing problems due to the lack of adequate and timely analysis feedback. In this project, a Rapid Clinker Analyzer (RCA) will be designed, built and evaluated to demonstrate that the system captures and analyzes data in a much faster and cost-effective manner to allow cement manufacturers to analyze product clinker in near-real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to significantly increase the use of alternative fuels in cement manufacturing. Widespread adoption of this technology will result in significant savings to cement manufacturers, while greatly reducing the use of fossil fuels. In addition, the shift to alternative fuels will reduce landfills, and thus mitigate negative environmental impacts of waste products. This new technology will also provide a unique advancement in analyzer technology because of the more rapid performance and smaller sample required.</AbstractNarration>
