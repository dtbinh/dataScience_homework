    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project evaluates a low cost, high efficiency&lt;br/&gt;portable power system called the QM Power ?PoD?? (Power on Demand). The PoD will power handheld&lt;br/&gt;consumer electronic devices (cell phones, tablets, laptops etc) utilizing a rechargeable battery and an&lt;br/&gt;advanced, mechanical energy generator system. QM Power, in conjunction with development partner&lt;br/&gt;Dell Engineering Services, will complete the design, analysis, prototyping and system integration of its&lt;br/&gt;generator technology into the PoD and will evaluate various accessories which allow the user to input&lt;br/&gt;mechanical energy via a crank, gravity assist mechanism or other methods. Research results from the&lt;br/&gt;Phase I effort indicate that utilizing QM Power generator technology in an auxiliary power/recharging&lt;br/&gt;system has the potential to reduce human input requirements by over 30% compared to state-of-the-art&lt;br/&gt;product offering now available.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are that the PoD will enable users to obtain critical power on&lt;br/&gt;demand and provide substantial environmental and public benefits (reducing grid dependence,&lt;br/&gt;disposable battery issues and providing power to emerging markets that lack access). Mobile devices&lt;br/&gt;have become increasingly power hungry while advances in battery energy density have not kept pace.&lt;br/&gt;As a result, the length of use, mobility, and ease use of these devices have been hampered. The QM&lt;br/&gt;Power PoD is designed as a hybrid, auxiliary power pack solution that combines a longer life&lt;br/&gt;rechargeable battery solution with a supplementary source of renewable, on-demand power that does not&lt;br/&gt;require access to the grid.</AbstractNarration>
