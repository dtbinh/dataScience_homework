    <AbstractNarration>CLEAR Scholars in Engineering is an S-STEM program for undergraduate engineering students in the School of Engineering and Technology at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). Each year up to 12 economically-disadvantaged and academically-prepared rising sophomore students are selected as CLEAR scholars. The program provides support to this diverse population of urban students from the sophomore year through graduation, with the goal of decreasing time spent in extracurricular employment, time to graduation, and indebtedness upon graduation; and increasing engagement with high-impact practices for academic and post-degree success. Leveraging existing academic and support services, CLEAR Scholars participate in a set of activities that promote retention, achievement, and persistence to graduation through: community-building through a cohort model; leadership and career development; engagement with industry; advising through mentoring; and resources for academic success. This program connects scholars who have similar financial challenges, and who share educational and career aspirations to help them integrate more fully into the academic culture through mentoring, leadership and career development, and other activities that support student success. The sophomore level is chosen as the point of intervention because students will have already completed freshman-level engineering coursework, demonstrating preparedness for engineering study as well as a continued need for academic, social, and financial support. The program actively engages campus and community stakeholders, including school administrators, faculty, and industry partners. Lessons learned from CLEAR Scholars inform other initiatives to improve the undergraduate experience for all engineering students at IUPUI.</AbstractNarration>
