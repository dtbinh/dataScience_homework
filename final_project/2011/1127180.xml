    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project plans to refine and test prototype facilities for commercialization of on-farm algae production and harvesting. Algae will be utilized initially for livestock feed and in future for bio-fuel. The project targets an emerging global market for construction of on-farm algae infrastructure. At the consumer level, the market is driven by favorable consumer response to Omega-3 health benefits in meat, milk, cheese and eggs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are: to increase scientific and technical knowledge of algae production for animal feed; to grow, harvest and utilize algae strains that might otherwise be overlooked; to improve consumer health, especially cardio-vascular health, and reduce obesity; to meet the demand for algae in livestock feed; and to construct algae facilities which will be able to expand into bio-fuel production when oil extraction technologies mature. On-farm algae production conserves energy and protects the environment by using less water, fuel, and fertilizer than land-based farming.</AbstractNarration>
