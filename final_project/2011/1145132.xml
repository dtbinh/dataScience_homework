    <AbstractNarration>Behavioral responses to taste stimuli include those leading to ingestion (mouth movements, tongue protrusion, etc.) and rejection (gapes, etc.). The neural circuitry required for these behaviors is contained within the brainstem. Several forebrain regions are connected to brainstem taste centers, but the functional roles of these connections have not been determined. Therefore, the specific goal of this study is to determine the behavioral roles of the descending projections from forebrain structures to gustatory centers in the brainstem. The general experimental approach will be to activate the descending projections with implanted electrodes in conscious rats and to observe changes in taste-related behaviors (particularly to salty and bitter stimuli). To understand the mechanisms of the behavioral effects, changes in the location, number and type of neurons in the gustatory brainstem, activated by forebrain stimulation, will be determined using a combination of anatomical and molecular techniques. It is expected that the results of this study will improve our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying taste-related behaviors and provide a foundation for future research on the role of these pathways in more complex behaviors. The broader impacts of the proposed activities include the involvement of a diverse undergraduate student population in scientific research, enhanced undergraduate student preparation for graduate work in the Biological Sciences, and published findings to disseminate the results of the experiments. Beyond those impacts, the proposed activities will increase interaction among scientists and students at Stetson University, enhance learning, teaching and training in classrooms and laboratories, and promote outreach to local middle- and high-school teachers and their students.</AbstractNarration>
