    <AbstractNarration>One of the most fascinating structures related to reproduction is the copulatory plug, a solidified mass derived from male seminal fluid that forms in the female reproductive tract shortly after mating. This structure occurs in most sexually reproducing animals, including many reptiles, birds, insects, rodents, and primates, yet its function remains poorly characterized. To address this gap in knowledge, a mouse model engineered with a defective copy of transglutaminase IV (Tgm4), a gene necessary for copulatory plug formation will be investigated. Preliminary data show that males who cannot form a copulatory plug suffer severe fertility defects; the main goals of this project are to figure out where reproductive failure occurs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research also has broader impacts on the surrounding community. Teachers and students from local inner city (Los Angeles) high schools will be incorporated into our scientific pursuits. A one week long Workshop on Molecular Evolution, a "hands on science" experience that guides participants from initial hypothesis, to experimental design and data collection, analysis and interpretation, and finally to publication will be a part of this project. In addition to collecting data necessary for this project, the Workshop will simultaneously demystify the scientific process and the university environment for high school students and teachers alike.</AbstractNarration>
