    <AbstractNarration>Through the College of Science Scholars Program, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona), an Hispanic Serving Institution, is leveraging the infrastructure of its Science Educational Enhancement Services (SEES) to increase the number of academically successful, financially disadvantaged STEM students in the College of Science. By the end of the project, Cal Poly Pomona will have awarded approximately 86 scholarships to academically successful, financially disadvantaged junior/senior STEM students with the majority of them having graduated with a B.S. degree and transitioned into the workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SEES supportive community counsels its members to effectively navigate the campus while providing opportunities for academic support, career networking, and community outreach. Activities of the College of Science Scholars Program include: &lt;br/&gt; - advising provided by SEES faculty; &lt;br/&gt; - peer-led support through Academic Excellence Workshops; &lt;br/&gt; - access to a study center for tutoring and computer facilities; and&lt;br/&gt; - professional development and workforce links through research apprenticeships, mentoring and cooperative education programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through these strategic activities, scholarship recipients are developing strong relationships with faculty and becoming efficient in their time to graduation. When these scholars graduate and join the workforce, they will be role models reflecting the highly diverse Cal Poly Pomona campus (approximately 35% of the students at Cal Poly Pomona are members of populations underrepresented in STEM fields) as well as exemplary representatives of Southern California.</AbstractNarration>
