    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for participants in a sequence of three regional conferences in applied mathematics to be held in the upstate New York area. These three meetings of the New York Conference on Applied Mathematics are to be held at the:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* State University of New York, Buffalo, on Saturday, April 16, 2011;&lt;br/&gt;* Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on Saturday, April 14, 2012; and&lt;br/&gt;* Cornell University on Saturday, April 13, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference programs, which will include talks in mathematical biology, imaging science, fluid mechanics, applications of dynamical systems, network theory, and numerical analysis, will also feature poster sessions, brief "research advertisement" presentations, and panel discussions on open problems and future directions in applied and computational mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference series will strengthen ties between applied mathematicians and scientists working in the upstate New York region and will allow researchers and students to stay abreast of a wide array of advances in applied and computational mathematics. The meetings encourage and support participation by students, junior researchers, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://acm.rit.edu/NYCAM</AbstractNarration>
