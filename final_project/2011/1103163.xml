    <AbstractNarration>This award enables the research team to continue their work on the ICECAP (ICE age Chemistry and Proxies) modeling project whose aim is to explore the utility of delta O-17 isotopes in ice core sulfate as a proxy for past oxidant levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally, the research will investigate the evolution of the atmosphere's oxidation capacity during the Last Glacial Maximum and pre-industrial Holocene through to the present-day. Specifically, the researchers aim to evaluate the relative roles of emissions and atmospheric dynamics in the variability of oxidants on glacial-interglacial timescales as well as any regional variation in sulfate and nitrate isotopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will support two graduate students and a high school science teacher. Successful completion of the work would improve the understanding of feedbacks between climate and the sources and sinks of methane, which would help improve our understanding of climate.</AbstractNarration>
