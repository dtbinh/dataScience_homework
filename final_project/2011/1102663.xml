    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research award is given to support broadening participation in the Mudd Design Workshop series that advances engineering design education. Travel supplements are awarded to allow participation by faculty from under-represented groups or who serve at minority serving institutions, and research on the effectiveness of design workshops on changing how design is taught will be conducted. By broadening participation in the workshops, the engineering design education community may become more able to develop engineering design courses to be more effective to a broader range of schools and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the technical infrastructure on which we depend has been designed by engineers. Design is a critical element of educating future engineers; the ability to design new products, services, and processes is a key engineering skill that is much needed to move to an innovation-driven economy. The Mudd Design Workshops have brought together design education practitioners to network, share best practices, and share advances in teaching design practices to engineering students. This award will help to understand the impact this workshop series has played in driving design education, as well as broaden participation to a wider range of students.</AbstractNarration>
