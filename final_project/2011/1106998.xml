    <AbstractNarration>The project concerns theoretical study of mathematical models of large random&lt;br/&gt;networks, with a focus on the following two settings. Certain observed features&lt;br/&gt;of the U.S. road network are consistent with it being approximately&lt;br/&gt;scale-invariant over scales of 5 - 500 miles. It is proposed to study&lt;br/&gt;mathematical properties of models that are exactly scale-invariant. Such study&lt;br/&gt;raises new foundational and substantive issues. Second, there is great current&lt;br/&gt;interest in information flow in social networks. Relevant abstract mathematical&lt;br/&gt;models are similar to models previously studied in many different scientific and&lt;br/&gt;engineering contexts (epidemics; broadcasting in computer networks; interacting&lt;br/&gt;particles in statistical physics). It is proposed to delineate a particular&lt;br/&gt;broad class (``Finite Markov Information Exchange") of such models, record what&lt;br/&gt;is already known about them, and formulate and investigate many new questions.&lt;br/&gt;The formulation of questions is guided by analogy with the well understood theory&lt;br/&gt;surrounding mixing times for finite Markov chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the research level, broader impacts envisaged from this research are&lt;br/&gt;facilitating the spread of techniques between different research communities&lt;br/&gt;and providing additional tools for the design, analysis and empirical&lt;br/&gt;investigation of large networks. At the postgraduate training level the&lt;br/&gt;second topic provides a fertile field of open problems and varying apparent&lt;br/&gt;difficulty, whose study will expose the student to a broad range of techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Both topics also fit well with the principal investigator's activities in&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate teaching (a "probability and the real world" course) and&lt;br/&gt;supervising undergraduate research projects.</AbstractNarration>
