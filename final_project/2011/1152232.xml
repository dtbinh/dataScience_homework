    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Kenneth Suslick at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Mr. Michael Schilling at the Getty Conservation Institute and their groups will develop a new approach to cumulative colorimetric sensor arrays and the development of a compact CCIS-based array analyzer for museum monitoring. Specifically, the PIs propose to (1) create new approaches to colorimetric sensor arrays to meet the extraordinary sensitivities demanded for artwork monitoring by the use of cumulative colorimetric sensors, (2) test newly developed arrays against the important museum pollutants at relevant concentrations, (3) construct a compact CCIS-based array analyzer, (4) create software to use the compact CCIS reader to identify pollutants for intermittent (e.g., hourly) wireless reporting, and (5) test the analyzer at the Getty Conservation Institute under more realistic conditions and with applications to specific curatory issues at the GCI. The proposed research, if successful, will provide a new and exceptionally powerful technology for molecular recognition and sensing and apply it to the low-cost monitoring of the environment and atmosphere (i.e., museum pollutants) in contact with artworks on display, in enclosed display cases, and in storage. In addition to significantly improve the process through which cultural heritage artifacts are stored, displayed and protected for the education, edification, and enjoyment of future generations. This collaborative project will strengthen ties between academic researchers and museum conservators extending the capabilities of both groups. Advanced student training at all levels from postdoctoral level to high school is expected. Research results will also be disseminated through scientific magazines targeting general public.</AbstractNarration>
