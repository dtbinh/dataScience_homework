    <AbstractNarration>Peer learning can provide students with an engaging learning environment that nurtures development of higher-order cognitive skills needed by engineers for innovation. This collaborative project led by the University of Oklahoma Norman Campus with partners from Tuskegee University and the Pennsylvania State University, University Park is using mobile smart devices to facilitate peer learning. Open ended problem solving ability is one key student outcome being enhanced by this project. In the Teaching to Learn (TeatoL) environment participants serve as both teacher and learner and will collectively learn from each other's experiences. The project is developing new understanding in how students (a) understand their own cognitive processes, (b) respond to peer teaching and learning, (c) can develop peer critique and reflection, (d) use mobile devices and social networks to enhance learning. In addition the project will develop a better understanding of how "flat" classrooms impact learning, and the impact of peer learning on underrepresented STEM students.</AbstractNarration>
