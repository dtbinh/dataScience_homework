    <AbstractNarration>The PI's request partial funding to support the publishing of a special issue of Oceanography magazine in September 2011 (volume 24, number 3) on the topic of Arctic oceanography. The Arctic Ocean is experiencing profound changes, including shrinking amounts of sea ice, ocean acidification, increasing ocean temperatures, all of which have consequences for Arctic ecosystems. The proposed set of peer reviewed papers will cover the geological, physical, chemical, biological, and human dimension aspects of recent Arctic change as observed during the recent International Polar Year. These topics represent major investments by US and international funding agencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed focus on the Arctic is timely and important, given rapidly changing conditions and the recent wealth of activity related to the IPY. This activity will advance understanding of the dynamically changing Arctic. With the intense focus on the Arctic by research funding agencies, government agencies and industry, publications such as this would be helpful for identifying gaps in research. The audience of TOS is broader than academic scientists, and is used by K-12 and informal educators as well as the academic community. And TOS has been a champion of helping scientists with education and outreach, through partnerships with COSEE and others.</AbstractNarration>
