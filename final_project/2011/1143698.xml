    <AbstractNarration>Funds are granted to the University of California - Berkeley to hold a three day workshop for pre-service and in-service teachers to inform the development of teaching modules, activities, and strategies related to the Understanding Sciences web page. The outcome of the workshop will be an online, flexible, interactive syllabus that will facilitate the integration of Understanding Sciences website material into science methods courses for pre-service teachers. The expected goals include: summarize the characteristics of science methods courses as pre-service teachers are currently being taught; articulate the resource needs of those who instruct pre-service teachers; recommend components of the Understanding Sciences website for incorporation into science methods courses and propose models for re-packaging if necessary; identify effective strategies for incorporating these resources into science methods courses; development of self-assessment materials for each section of Understanding Science 101; and determine strategies for dissemination. Attendees at the meeting will include members of the Understanding Science project, pre-service teacher educators, in-service teachers, scientists, and science educators from around the country. The workshop will take place at the University Of California Museum Of Paleontology, Berkeley in early 2012.</AbstractNarration>
