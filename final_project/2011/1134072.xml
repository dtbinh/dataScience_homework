    <AbstractNarration>This project supports travel expenses for participants at the workshop on advances in language and vision. In the past few years, great progress has been made in the fields of language and computer vision in developing technologies of extracting semantic content from text and imagery respectively. Each field has desires to adapt methods from the other, but often looking to the past literature rather than the current state of the art. This workshop makes significant scientific progress in multimodal representations and methods by bringing together the top researchers in both fields. The well organized brainstorming and discussion sessions contribute new ideas to this emerging area. The outcome of the workshop provides some guidelines for targeted research in this interdisciplinary area, including anticipated fundamental scientific advances, possible large-scale challenge problems, the needs and prospects for available datasets, and connections to significant applications and their associated long-term economic impact and other societal benefits.</AbstractNarration>
