    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research will strengthen the CdTe PV innovation ecosystem. CdTe PV is now economically viable in many applications and suitable for gigawattscale implementation. The project will utilize CSU's state-of-the-art deposition system to pursue two separate routes to higher-efficiency manufacturing-friendly cells: (1) higher voltage from a new device structure that employs a Cd1-xMgxTe electron-reflector layer to reduce electron recombination, and (2) higher current with a larger band-gap CdS layer achieved by the incorporation of plasma activated oxygen species. The project will develop novel semiconductor alloys, novel processing methods, novel defect-passivation approaches, and novel device structures. At the same time, detailed understanding of the defects, interfaces, and the device physics of the advanced devices will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most significant broader impact is the production of clean energy globally on an unprecedented scale. This will provide a major benefit for the U.S. economy and will create thousands of well-paying jobs in the U.S. It builds on the success of the CdTe PV industry, which now has the lowest cost-structure and largest production of any U.S. PV technology. . It also builds on the technology-transfer experience of the PI, co-founder of Abound Solar which has grown to 370 employees with current manufacturing at 65 MW/Yr and a near term target of 200 MW/Yr. This project will also provide well-trained students for the photovoltaic industry, which is growing rapidly and requires a highly skilled workforce. The PV-training approach at CSU is strongly team based: students from different disciplines work closely with each other, with engineers from industry, and in many cases with students at other universities.</AbstractNarration>
