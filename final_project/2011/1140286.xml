    <AbstractNarration>This project takes a two pronged approach to engage science students early in their academic career as a means of reducing the problem of low retention of majors during subsequent years. One effort, Biopods, utilizes electronic media and classroom discussion to provide an early introduction of students to career opportunities open to biology majors. Biopods also help students see the merits of becoming active self-learners and participating in research. The other effort, AMOEBA (Authentic Mentoring of Engaged Biologists Alliance), engages biology faculty in establishing research modules to replace the traditional Introductory Biology 2 experience with laboratory activities based upon ongoing research activities at the institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: Preliminary trials of the AMOEBA approach (based on stable isotope exploration of the effects of sugar uptake on the elemental and ecological stoichiometry of fern gametophytes and biotic soil crust organisms) indicates that students can: contribute to the research; appreciate the importance of the interdisciplinary studies they were doing; and are enthusiastic about continuing these type of courses and continuing on as biology majors. An added intellectual merit is that the courses are designed to include upper division as well as lower division students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty and graduate students all working together on real research problems and pooling their efforts, thus transforming introductory courses into a collaborative research alliance that engages students in a biology learning community during an early phase of their academic careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Successful implementation of these techniques at a typical state university can provide a model that can transform approaches at similar institutions that both benefit the students in the courses and introduce graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty to their potential as advocates and practitioners of effective and intellectually challenging approaches to undergraduate education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts toward Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education.</AbstractNarration>
