    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I&lt;br/&gt;project will develop a long lasting organic formulation to effectively manage and&lt;br/&gt;suppress populations of mosquito vectors of disease. The banning of DDT and&lt;br/&gt;other persistent mosquito larvicides several decades ago has created a major gap&lt;br/&gt;in vector management that has yet to be effectively filled by generations of&lt;br/&gt;environmentally friendly chemicals and formulations that followed. The&lt;br/&gt;consequences are tangible to the human population worldwide. We are currently&lt;br/&gt;experiencing more pain, suffering, and deaths from mosquito transmitted&lt;br/&gt;diseases than when DDT was available. Biological larvicidal formulations have&lt;br/&gt;been proven safe and effective in controlling mosquito larvae, with the caveat&lt;br/&gt;that they have a very short field life which requires frequent reapplications to&lt;br/&gt;sustain control, in turn making them too expensive for adoption by most areawide&lt;br/&gt;vector control programs. Because of this, biological larvicidal formulations&lt;br/&gt;are seldom used preventatively. This SBIR project will bridge this gap and&lt;br/&gt;increase the longevity, and usability, of biological larvicides. Success will result in&lt;br/&gt;direct mitigation of soil and waterways pollution commonly associated with&lt;br/&gt;conventional pesticides for mosquito control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are, if&lt;br/&gt;this SBIR project is successful, the development of a biological, long lasting&lt;br/&gt;larvicidal formulation that will significantly change the way parasitic mosquitoes&lt;br/&gt;are managed worldwide, making it much more effective, reducing disease and&lt;br/&gt;suffering, and saving lives while significantly reducing non-target effects and&lt;br/&gt;environmental pollution. This is a worldwide market opportunity of over&lt;br/&gt;$2B/year.</AbstractNarration>
