    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The FASEB Summer Conference II will be held on the Ciocco Resort in Lucca Italy, September 4 - 9, 2011. This is the second conference that rotates between the US and Europe. The first conference was held in 2009. This initial conference spurred considerable interdisciplinary cross-talk and spawned new collaborative studies between scientists working in areas that have been historically studied separately. There aren't any other conferences that focus on the NAD metabolome as a whole. The major areas of NAD metabolism and signaling research will be represented. The following nine sessions will be covered: NAD Biosynthesis and Metabolism (2 sessions), NAD metabolites and signaling, NAD dependent protein deacetylation by sirtuins, Poly-ADP-ribose metabolism, NAD crosstalk and biology, Mono-ADP ribosylation, Mechanisms of NAD-dependent gene regulation and Translational studies of NAD metabolism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The 2011 FASEB Summer conference on NAD Metabolism and Signalling will bring together a highly diverse group of scientists working in all areas of NAD-related metabolism and biology and provide a forum for exchange of information and data. The topics and themes that will be covered in this meeting will be global in nature, allowing for a unique interdisciplinary scientific experience that is not provided by other more specialized meetings that focus on only one aspect of NAD metabolism. Also, the conference will foster new interactions between scientists that do not normally meet one another in the course of their work.</AbstractNarration>
