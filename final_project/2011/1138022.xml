    <AbstractNarration>This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in the summer of 2012 on the topic of nuclear C*-algebras. The principal speaker will be Professor Wilhelm Winter from the University of Muenster. This award will support 24 participants at different stages of their careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on the recent advances made by Dr. Winter and his colleagues in nuclear C*-algebras and their connections with topological dynamical systems. Lectures will be designed to be accessible to graduate students and mathematicians with only basic knowledge of C*-algebras, and new open problems which present good research opportunities for graduate students will be discussed.</AbstractNarration>
