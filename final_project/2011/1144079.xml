    <AbstractNarration>This project will test two likely mechanisms for the maintenance of biological diversity in natural habitats, the creation of fine-scale variation in the environment by dominant plant species and by natural disturbance by fire. Some of the most diverse plant communities in North America are found in the fire-prone longleaf pine forest of the southeastern United States. Although the forest canopy generally has only a few species of plants, and the plants beneath are often dominated by one or two species of large, long-lived bunchgrasses, a high number of smaller plant species can be found scattered between the grasses. Researchers will experimentally alter interactions between bunchgrasses, interactions between bunchgrasses and smaller plants, and environmental conditions such as fire intensity to show how dominant plant species influence the diversity and dynamics of high-diversity plant communities in environments prone to disturbance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Longleaf pine ecosystems historically covered most of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains, but human activities such as fire suppression have reduced the area of the forests by more than 98%. This project will inform efforts to manage and restore these ecosystems. In particular, a workshop will bring together land managers, conservation professionals, and ecologists to synthesize relevant information about these ecosystems, identify important gaps in our understanding of these floristic treasures, and translate the results into recommendations for conservation, management, and restoration. In addition, the project will train undergraduate and graduate students in science and provide educational outreach activities for K-12 students and educators.</AbstractNarration>
