    <AbstractNarration>This workshop adds two two-day research/evaluation training workshops to the Society for Education Effectiveness Meeting (SREE) that will take place in Washington D.C. in October 2011. This SREE meeting has mathematics and science education research and evaluation as its focus. The first workshop will examine research design, and will specifically focus on the design of experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation studies. The second will examine ideas of multilevel populations and samples, and their implications for multilevel theories in evaluation research and for the analysis of experiments and quasi-experiments. SREE is funded by the U.S. Department of Education and having NSF support a pre-session workshop on quantitative research design is a nice connection with the U.S. Department of Education. NSF PIs and contractors will be targeted to participate and the workshops should increase the number of quantitative research designs submitted by proposers to NSF programs.</AbstractNarration>
