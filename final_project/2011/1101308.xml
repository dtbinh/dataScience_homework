    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Shaik Jeelani has served at Tuskegee University (TU)for more than 36 years as Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Associate Dean and Interim Dean of Engineering and Architecture, and Vice President for Research and Sponsored Programs. He spearheaded the development of TU's first Ph.D. program in Materials Science and Engineering, which was launched in 1998. He recruited, mentored and graduated 19 Ph.D. students through this program within a short period, contributing to TU becoming the largest producer of African American Ph.D.s in Materials Science and Engineering. Tuskegee University is also well known for its innovative K-12 programs, all designed and implemented by Dr. Jeelani. He has won numerous awards including the United Negro College Professor of the Year Award, the 1996 Outstanding Contribution for Mentoring Award by the National Association of Minority Engineering Program Administrators, and the 2001 Global Messenger Award for mentoring K-12 students and teachers. The Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in Engineering (SECME) established an award in Dr. Jeelani's name, entitled "The Shaik Jeelani Selfless Service Award," which is presented each year to a SECME constituent who goes beyond the call of duty in providing effective mentoring for students.</AbstractNarration>
