    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The Keystone Symposia Meeting on "Nuclear Events in Plant Gene Expression and Signaling will be held March 6-10, 2012 at the Sagebrush Inn and Conference Center in Taos, New Mexico. This conference aims to stimulate the synthesis of an integrative view of nuclear dynamics in plant biology. Keystone Symposia meetings have an excellent reputation for initiating and fostering collaborations, and for participation by trainees and other junior investigators. The specific objectives of the conference include: 1) Break the confines of (often artificially defined) fields of study to broaden the vision and resources of scientists and 2) Educate new and future scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The organizers of Keystone Symposia meetings strive to promote and ensure diversity (including women and underrepresented groups) in the speaker lineup and in meeting participation. There will be early career scientists, students and postdoctoral trainees attending the meeting. Overall, the conference will provide a unique opportunity for scientific and professional development of trainees and newer investigators.</AbstractNarration>
