    <AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2012- 2014. The program focuses on molecular biosciences - the application of biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, cell biology, genomics, proteomics, and computational and structural biology - to solve complex problems in biology in a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary environment. Numerous faculty from several relevant departments will serve as research mentors. A wide variety of interesting projects at the cutting edge of molecular bioscience will be available for the students. In addition to working full-time in their chosen research labs, students will participate in professional development activities including training in the responsible conduct of research, reading and presenting reports from the primary scientific literature, poster preparation and presentation, career opportunities in academia, industry and government, the graduate school application process, an optional GRE Prep course, writing an effective personal statement, and effective interviewing skills. Students will have ample opportunities to interact with students from additional programs hosted by the university during the summer, as well as with graduate students and post-doctoral fellows who assist in professional development activities. Students are recruited via a dedicated web site, visits to local universities (especially those with a large number of underrepresented minority students), during national meetings such as ASBMB and SACNAS, and targeted e-mails. Selection of participants is based upon GPA, lack of availability of concentrated research experiences at the student's home college or university, interest in research as indicated through a Personal Statement, and perceived potential for, and interest in, a career in biological research. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool.
