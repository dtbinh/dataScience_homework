    <AbstractNarration>F420 Cofactor Dependent Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (FGD) catalyzes the conversion of Glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone. The enzymology of F420 dependent enzymes, such as FGD, has not yet been subject to rigorous investigation. The overall goal of this research is to understand the function and hydride transfer reactivity of FGD from Mycobacterium tuberculosis using site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), steady-state and pre-steady state methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will support the training of minority students in biochemistry. This work will also enhance the quality of education for participating students because they will acquire essential biochemical skills in the field of enzymology. As an African-American female, the PI is aware of the scarcity of under-represented groups in the scientific community and would like to provide mentoring opportunities to all students interested, including those from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
