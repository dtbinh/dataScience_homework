    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the continuation of the existing physics Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator Based Sciences (CLASSE). Supported by the National Science Foundation, the Laboratory has an international reputation for research, with a unique constellation of programs including accelerator physics, synchrotron radiation research, and microwave superconductivity. The student participants have a ten week research experience during the summer at the Laboratory, and have full access to the resources of the Laboratory and University. The undergraduate researchers in this program work closely with Laboratory experienced physicists and they use group housing together with many other REU groups on campus. The students participate in joint activities that include lectures with an overview of wide topics in the accelerator physics, X-ray science, take part with a bigger body of REU groups on campus in fun-talks and hands-on activities that introduce various frontiers of physics research, as well as events geared towards teaching the students about social and ethics issues in scientific research and conduct.</AbstractNarration>
