    <AbstractNarration>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive type of primary brain tumor in humans with a median survival time of about 14 months. As the expected survival time is so short, treatment plans must be made quickly and are traditionally based on population statistics instead of the individual tumor kinetics of the presenting patient. This research is directed at creating a cyberinfrastructure system such that the physician would be able to explore individual tumor kinetics for treatment planning via simulated treatment of a virtual tumor based on mathematical models and patient-specific data. If such a system could be shown reliable with quantifiable uncertainty, it could significantly transform current medical practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GBM's tend to grow with constant rates and to expand diffusively, allowing for surprisingly accurate results from relatively simple reaction-diffusion models. This research aims to push such results further by providing quantifiable uncertainty in the model simulations. Proof of concept is to be shown using currently available sequences of serial MRI images from past patients for the calibration of model parameters and then testing the validity of the model against a final MRI image. This approach differs from earlier work in that parameters are described with probability density functions characterizing the uncertainty in their values and Bayesian methods are being employed to solve the statistical inverse problems. This theory provides an all-inclusive framework for identifying the key features of a predictive model and characterizing uncertainty. Methods of reducing data containing high-dimensional feature sets to a form compatible with statistical inverse methods are being investigated. Additionally, the researcher is developing a fast, parallel and adaptive solver so that sophisticated statistical sampling techniques are feasible</AbstractNarration>
