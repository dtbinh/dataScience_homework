    <AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the possibility that a new approach to deriving a linear theory of the tearing mode instability in space plasmas can be successfully developed. Such a linear theory would then form the basis of a full non-linear theory of magnetic reconnection in a collisonless plasma. Previous analytical work on the linear tearing mode relied on using an asymptotic approach to make the equations tractable. However, fullly kinetic, particle simulations have indicated that the asymptotic approach breakes down in most realistic geometries. The purpose of this exploratory resarch is threefold: &lt;br/&gt;1) Determine why the asymptotic appoach breaks down and develop a new approach using an exact linear Vlasov solver to determine the conditions where a direct transition from linear theory to non-linear turbulence occurs; 2) Determine whether or not the formation of secondary tearing island formation is due to a linear instability; 3) Examine the controversial question of whether linear mode properties have a significant influence on the resulting reconnection rate in large systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project that has the potential to transform the way magnetic reconnection is treated in plasma theory and simulations. It could affect our understanding of phenomena on the sun, in the solar wind, in planetary magnetospheres and in astrophysical plasmas.</AbstractNarration>
