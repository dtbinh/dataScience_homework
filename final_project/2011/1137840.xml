    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to help support student attendance at the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) in Kyoto, Japan to be held on January 17-19, 2012. SODA is the premier conference that covers research in algorithmic aspects of combinatorics, discrete mathematics, and computer science and their applications in the sciences and business. Research on algorithms is one of the most important and active areas in computing. Algorithmic questions pervade business, technology, and science and their study continues to be a major research topic. SODA produces one of the most widely read proceedings in algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the students who have papers accepted at the conference may not be able to obtain sufficient support from their home institutions. Attendance is particularly valuable for students who are just starting out and are more likely to profit from direct NSF support. By providing it, the NSF will be able to help nurture a new generation of researchers in this key area.</AbstractNarration>
