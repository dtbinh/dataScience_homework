    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the acquisition of high-performance computing (HPC) equipment that will enable research in the area of gravitational-wave physics relevant to ground-based GW detectors, such as the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). The research enabled by this equipment focuses on both modeling the astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, as well as the development of computational tools for the analysis of gravitational-wave signals obtained by LIGO, bringing together a collaboration of physicists with computer scientists and applied mathematicians. The hybrid character of the equipment originates from the incorporation of cutting-edge Graphics Programming Units (GPUs appropriate for scientific computing) used as accelerators for massively parallel computations in additional to regular computing units. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of gravitational wave sources is important in many other areas of physics and the enabled research work has a strong interdisciplinary character. The equipment will further enable the multi-faceted training of students in HPC technology and computational research, including algorithmic development for GPUs most desirable for a technically sophisticated workforce, competitive in the 21st century. A small fraction of the computing time resources will also be coupled to another NSF-funded project at Northwestern, a GK-12 program; these resources will bring computational thinking and simulation tools to K-12 classroom through activities and modules tied to the science curriculum thus engaging teachers and students in inquiry-based learning, understanding of the research process, and advancing communication and outreach skills of the graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
