    <AbstractNarration>The award is to support the series of workshops on security in emerging areas that are affiliated with the 2011 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), and will be held on October 17-21st, 2011 in Chicago, IL. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The annual ACM Computer and Communications Security Conference is a leading international forum for information security researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools and experiences. Since year 2001, CCS started accommodating series of workshops to explore security issues in a variety of emerging areas. CCS workshops quickly become active forums for researchers to form focus groups, discuss and collaborate on emerging and critical security problems, and disseminate fresh, revolutionary (and sometimes even controversial) ideas. These workshops also serve as natural venues to bring together researchers from multiple disciplines to address security issues in specific domains, such as smartphone technology, cloud computing and national critical infrastructures.</AbstractNarration>
