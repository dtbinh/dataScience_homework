    <AbstractNarration>This project is a partnership between Snohomish School District and Everett Community College. Everett Community College will use facilities provided by Snohomish School District to teach Advanced Manufacturing skills. The partnership will better utilize equipment and facilities, allow middle and high school students access to advanced equipment, provide professional development for teachers and engage young students exciting them to study STEM fields. The opportunities provided by the work will increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who study STEM fields and enter the workforce. Since the local need for manufacturing workers, especially in aerospace, is expected to grow a well educated worker is a critical element to the continued success of the Snohomish County and Regional economy and this work will help ensure these workers are prepared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will increase the number of industry certificate holders in the area of advanced manufacturing by 20%, increase the number of associate degree holders with experience in advanced manufacturing by 100% and increase the number of community college transfers to a four-year institution by 15%. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The applied learning/training in the program will increase student scientific literacy and provide more opportunity to be creative and create connections to business and industry making study more relevant and focused. The project's dual enrollment benefits student enrollment and early mentoring and could become a model that can be duplicated nation-wide.</AbstractNarration>
