    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #1138242&lt;br/&gt;Title: 2011 HENAAC Conference&lt;br/&gt;P.I. Gary Cruz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed HENAAC Conference, operated by Great Minds in STEMTM (GMiS), is one of the nationally recognized STEM conferences targeting the academic and professional development of Hispanic men and women. In its continuing efforts to foster the professional development of K-12 educators, undergraduate and graduate students, the HENAAC Conference introduced two new initiatives in 2010 (the Technical Posters Competition and the K-12 Educators? Institute). The P.I. requests fund to support the Technical Posters Competition and the K-12 Educators? Institute at the 2011 HENAAC Conference. This request will support 60 undergraduate and graduate students in the Technical Posters Competition, and 50 K-12 teachers and administrators in the K-12 Educators? Institute. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Technical Posters Competition targets undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups, especially women and students of color, to enhance broadening participation initiatives. Solicitation for participation is marketed to Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI). &lt;br/&gt;The K-12 Educators? Institute will recruit approximately 50 principals, counselors, teachers, and pre-service teachers from both local and non-local K-12 schools in Hispanic-Serving School Districts. &lt;br/&gt;Both the Technical Posters Competition and K-12 Educators? Institute will enhance infrastructure for research and education through the development of networks and partnerships. For technical poster session, the forum provides an opportunity to recognize and celebrate academic scholarships. It also provides a networking opportunity with other STEM professionals. For K-12 educators, the Institute provides a forum for exchanging ideas, learning new culturally relevant teaching mechanisms, and networking with STEM professionals. &lt;br/&gt;The benefits of the programs reside in the dissemination of its knowledge. Through a Technical Posters Competition proceeding, the students' abstracts will be disseminated and available for online viewing. The abstracts are required to indicate the value of the proposed research to the public. The K-12 Educators? Institute provides opportunity for educators to incorporate the knowledge and resources gained into their curriculum. In addition, materials and resources from relative seminars and workshops will be provided to educators. Educators will have access to Hispanic STEM role models contact information to invite them into classrooms during the students and parents STEM activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is cofunded by two directorates: ENG and GEO.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is exempt from external review in accordance with the PAM, chapter V.B.2.n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omnia El-Hakim, Ph.D.-Program Director &lt;br/&gt;For Diversity and Outreach</AbstractNarration>
