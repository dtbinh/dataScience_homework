    <AbstractNarration>1133222&lt;br/&gt;Wax&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to develop ms/LCI (multiple scattering/low coherence interferometry) to image through thick tissues with multiply scattered light. The specific tasks proposed are: &lt;br/&gt;1. Instrument development:The system will be modified to enable optical scanning and multispectral interferometric imaging. Optical scanning will improve the speed of acquiring 2D images while inclusion of multiple illumination wavelengths will allow recovery of important biochemical information such as hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation. &lt;br/&gt;2. Theoretical modeling:To better understand the mechanisms of imaging contrast in this approach the PI will take a dual pronged effort to model the light propagation. An analytical form is presented which is based on a random walk formalism that will be used to evaluate this imaging modality. To validate this model, they will also use Monte Carlo modeling as well as comparing to experimental results. &lt;br/&gt;3. Demonstrate imaging of hemoglobin distribution in thick tissues.To demonstrate the utility of the method, they will image hemoglobin distribution through thick (~1 cm) tissues. Samples will include tissue phantoms, designed to validate the method, and ex vivo animal tissues, such as muscle and fat as would be encountered in breast imaging and retinal samples as would be used in OCT ophthalmic imaging, where penetration to the choroid has remained a challenge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will advance a novel imaging modality with unique potential to extend imaging depth. In addition, new multispectral interferometry instrumentation will advance optical engineering while the proposed random walk model will advance understanding of light propagation in tissues.</AbstractNarration>
