    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports the renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Georgetown University. This award seeks to renew the REU program in the Chemistry Department at Georgetown University (GU). The 10-week program runs from Memorial Day through early-August of each year, and will include a minimum of 15 participants - 9 non-GU students recruited from across the country, as well as 6 internally-funded participants. Recruitment efforts will target students without significant prior research experience, with special consideration given to creating a diverse participant group drawn largely from institutions without graduate-level research programs, underrepresented groups, and "first generation" college students. The primary research and education goals are to: (1) Provide a positive hands-on research experience for undergraduates that leads to engagement with the broader chemistry community either through conferences or publications, (2) Develop and implement an effective cross-disciplinary program for training mentors of undergraduate researchers, and, (3) Positively influence student attitudes towards professions in chemistry so that they will pursue careers in the field. As members of actively funded research groups, all REU participants will acquire skills in designing and conducting experimental work and analyzing scientific data. REU students will participate in a series of weekly workshops covering a variety of professional development topics, seminars, and field trips. Exposure to the research of many different scientists and to other departmental and inter-departmental social events, will provide significant opportunities for student-student and student-faculty formal and informal exchanges. A comprehensive evaluation plan, which uses pre- and post- program surveys as well as small focus group interviews, will be used to assess both the student and mentor experiences with the program, as well as its long-term impact on the career paths of the REU participants. Modifications to the previous program cycle focus largely on implementing an expanded mentoring program, creating more opportunities for interactions among students and with local scientists, and targeted efforts to expand the pool and yield of minority and "first generation" applicants.</AbstractNarration>
