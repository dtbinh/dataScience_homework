    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This three-year REU site program will engage a diverse cohort of students in research projects within the intellectual theme of Bioengineering with a focus on innovation. Each student will conduct research mentored by a faculty member and graduate student on a project specifically designed for his/her abilities. The six participating faculty span multiple departments and have a strong history of involving undergraduates in research, leading to numerous awards, manuscripts, and conference presentations. To foster a strong sense of community amongst the students, the program will begin with a "Boot Camp" and all research will be conducted in a new multidisciplinary research center. Weekly workshops including creativity, communication, mentoring, and ethics will help the students gain professional skills and personal confidence critical for young students success in innovative research. A unique feature of this REU site program is that the students will be trained in mentoring for outreach to middle school girls in a week-long Bioengineering Innovation Program. The programs' evaluation plan focuses on desired outcomes, has multiple formative and summative elements, and uses valid and reliable instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The proposed integrated training experience will not only expose a diverse cohort of students to research, but will also help them see how a scientific career can be possible for them as part of a rich personal life. Further, participants will appreciate how their involvement in science and engineering can benefit the next generation of students. The Principal Investigators (PIs) have developed a strong, proven plan for effectively recruiting from underrepresented groups of students and for providing authentic research projects that encourage confidence and self esteem. The innovative thinking fostered by this program will encourage students to think more broadly and creatively about the potential implications and impact of their work. For the middle school students, participation will increase their interest in science and their confidence in their abilities with the aim of increasing their retention in math and science courses essential for engineering careers. The programs' research results will be disseminated broadly through scientific and lay publications, conference presentations, and the Web, by the PIs, participating faculty, and students alike.</AbstractNarration>
