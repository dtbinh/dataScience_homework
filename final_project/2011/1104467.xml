    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The 2011 CSHL Conference on Eukaryotic mRNA Processing will be held in New York, August 23-27, 2011. As in the previous meetings, a major focus will be on nuclear events in mRNA maturation, particularly mRNA splicing and polyadenylation, but the scope will now be expanded to encompass both the impact of the history of an mRNA on its ultimate biological fate, the emerging fields of RNA interference and microRNA function as well as the application of informatics and genome-wide approaches to the analysis of RNA processing. It will span a broad range of areas of investigation including genetics, genomics, biochemistry, molecular biology and biophysical approaches to understand the mechanisms and physiologic consequences of the many processing steps that can impinge on a nascent pre-mRNA transcript to control gene expression. The meeting format will consist of eight plenary sessions and two poster sessions. For the 2011 meeting, each plenary session will be subdivided into two parts that focus on related but separate topics. The most recent meeting was held in August 2009 and attracted 335 scientists internationally, who are actively investigating various aspects of messenger RNA maturation in eukaryotic cells, using genetic, biochemical, molecular, and cell biological approaches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The 2011 CSHL Conference on Eukaryotic mRNA Processing will bring together a highly diverse group of scientists seeking to share and promote knowledge in the field and provide an outlet for collaboration and exchange of ideas. The 2011 CSHL conference committee has made every effort to include the participation of groups underrepresented in science.</AbstractNarration>
