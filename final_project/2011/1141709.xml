    <AbstractNarration>Developers and researchers from the Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications (COMAP) and Teachers College are developing a Mathematical Modeling Handbook to assist high school mathematics teachers as they try to integrate mathematical modeling into their curricula. The handbook is available in both an electronic and paper format. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Researchers at COMAP, working with advisors from Teachers College, are creating 25 fully developed modeling lessons that can be used and adapted by high school mathematics teachers. Teachers have contributed to the lessons and will pilot the lessons containing mathematical content, strategies for building and adapting mathematical models, pedagogical ideas and mathematical applications, The development team is also investigating how the lessons are used and working with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics, and the Association of State Supervisors to ensure a broad dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSM) call for the practice of mathematical modeling to be taught in mathematics classes and this project provides a valuable resource that is not currently available for high school teachers. The team-developed materials and associated research on their use are examples of strategies to assist teachers in implementing the practice standards of the CCSSM.</AbstractNarration>
