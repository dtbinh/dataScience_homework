    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports the research of Dr. Lorenzo Sadun on the dynamics, topology and ergodic theory of aperiodic tilings. The focus is on several classes of tilings that are more complicated than previously studied. This includes hierarchical "fusion" tilings, akin to self-similar "substitution" tilings, only where the structure can be qualitatively different at each length scale. It also includes tilings with infinite local complexity (where tiles fit together in infinitely many local patterns) and tilings of non-Euclidean spaces where the relevant group action is not amenable. In each setting, the goal is to understand which combinatorial, topological and ergodic properties of simpler tilings carry over, and to create examples where other properties do not. A further goal is to address the broad conceptual question: how do ergodic and topological properties of a tiling space relate to geometric properties of the underlying tilings?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tiling theory has many applications within science and engineering and has been used to model materials such as quasicrystals, to code information on computers, and to solve abstract problems in logic. However, much of the theory is built around a small set of classic examples, mere islands in the sea of possible tilings. This project aims to bridge these islands, developing both a more general theory and qualitatively new examples, examples that will allow for a still broader range of applications. For example, tilings of curves spaces may aid in the design of efficient computer networks. In addition to supporting basic research, the grant supports the training of a PhD student in the mathematical sciences, thereby addressing a severe shortage of young American scientists. It also supports visits by researchers who will give lectures to graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
