    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalyis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation will support the research program of Professor Mikhail Zamkov at Bowling Green State University. Professor Zamkov and his students will combine novel synthesis strategies for the formation of composite charge-separating nanoparticles coupled with metallic catalyst particles, with ultra-fast spectroscopy of photoinduced charge transfer processes at the interfaces in these particles. This work will address the nature of charge transfer across these heterojunction interfaces, contributing to the basic understanding of electron dynamics in these nanomaterials. Such nanomaterial systems show promise for use as photocatalysts in water splitting reactions for the production of hydrogen and other solar fuels. The work of this project will serve to train students in the fundamental physics and chemistry of sustainable energy technologies, as well as to provide the foundation for the development of these possibly important catalytic materials.</AbstractNarration>
