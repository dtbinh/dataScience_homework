    <AbstractNarration>Photovoltaics is a broad field that spans materials to systems and includes mature technologies like crystalline silicon, new ones like organic solar cells, and exploratory, third generation concepts. Success requires contributions from chemistry and materials science, to device design and characterization, to manufacturing and system level considerations. Theory, modeling, and simulation is well-established in photovoltaics, but the field is fragmented according to the interests and disciplines of researchers and the technologies being explored and lacks the critical mass to be effective. The workshop, Challenges in Photovoltaic Science, Technology, and Manufacturing: A workshop on the role of theory, modeling, and simulation will provide an opportunity for researchers from academia, industry, and the national laboratories to identify ways to advance the field of photovoltaics. Multiscale modeling and simulation is a pervasive challenge in science and engineering. Addressing this challenge for photovoltaics, will contribute to success in other disciplines. The workshop will identify models for universities to collaborate across disciplines and for universities and companies to pursue collaborative research that will have broad impact beyond photovoltaics.</AbstractNarration>
