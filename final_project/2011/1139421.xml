    <AbstractNarration>An Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education Conference (ITiCSE) working group is examining the educational missions and curricula of two and four-year institutions with respect to information assurance education. Participants in this workshop will define and describe the distinct and complementary missions of two and four-year institutions with respect to information assurance education, describe the differences and similarities of the educational programs at two and four-year institutions, and document the challenges and opportunities for information assurance course articulation between two and four-year institutions. Travel support is provided for nine information assurance educators and researchers to attend and participate. This workshop continues the work of similar 2009 and 2010 working groups which reviewed the state of information assurance education throughout the world and created a detailed list of critical information assurance topics to be used as the foundation for curriculum development.</AbstractNarration>
