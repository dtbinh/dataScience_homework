    <AbstractNarration>This project aims to satisfy the increasing need for medical physics course material that is accessible to undergraduate STEM and health science majors, and it links the teaching of physics to important applications in the medical field. The primary goal of this project is to develop educational material for medical applications in physics. The resulting materials are modular and can be used as a whole in a specialized "Physics in Medicine" course or in part for introductory physics classes. Six modules are being developed for important medical topics like electrocardiography, optical instruments, ultrasound imaging, laser eye surgery, radiation, and magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this project results in worksheets for group discussions, medical physics laboratory exercises, homework assignments, in-class activities, use with existing computer-based physics simulations, and formative and summative assessments to evaluate students' understanding. The development of these teaching materials is being done in a collaboration of experts from the fields of physics and medicine to foster opportunities for students to apply interdisciplinary critical reasoning skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student learning is being evaluated by utilizing both formative and summative pre and post assessments of skills, knowledge, and attitudes for each of the learning modules (6 assessments total). In collaboration with the PIs, the external evaluator is developing a student evaluation of the course which is used to make adjustments of the modules and to help judge their overall success in teaching this material. The advisory board. consisting of experts in medicine and physics. is providing further guidance on the soundness of the developed material. All course materials produced during the project are being disseminated to educators via the "Physics in Medicine" course website and commercial partners. Subsequently, reports on learning outcomes are being prepared for peer-reviewed journal articles and presentations at academic conferences.</AbstractNarration>
