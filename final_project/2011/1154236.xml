    <AbstractNarration>"The SMaRT Scholars for Success" program at Northampton Community College is increasing the number of low-income, academically talented women and minorities in multiple STEM programs by implementing best practices for enhancing the recruitment, retention, and successful transfer or employment of students underrepresented in STEM. The program is working to address the financial, academic, and emotional barriers that can prove formidable for all students and often affect traditionally underrepresented students most significantly. Scholars are supported as a "Community of Learners" through participation in a summer retreat, learning circles by discipline, common courses, and other cohort building activities. A high level of academic support is provided by a Student Success Specialist, tutors, career advisors, faculty and industrial mentors, experiential learning opportunities and workshops to develop leadership and soft skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"SMaRT Scholars for Success" provides a model for increasing the recruitment, retention, and success rate of students underrepresented in STEM disciplines. Most of the strategies used in this project can be implemented at modest cost to a comparable institution. With community colleges accounting for 46% of the nation's undergraduates and over half of all minorities in higher education, the project offers the opportunity for broad impact on the STEM pipeline.</AbstractNarration>
