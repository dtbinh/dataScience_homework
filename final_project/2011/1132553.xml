    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Dorothy Zolandz of the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences is supported by the Chemistry Division to convene a workshop with leaders from the academic and industrial chemistry community to frame possible research areas that should be considered under a Sustainable Chemistry Basic Research program. This workshop is to be done partially in response to the America Competes Reauthorization Act of 2010, which calls for the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish a Green Chemistry Basic Research program to award competitive, merit-based grants to support research into green and sustainable chemistry. This workshop addresses the society's critical need for safer, economical, and more environmentally sustainable chemical products and processes. This one-day workshop will engage about 20 technical experts drawn from both industry and academe to discuss the most pressing questions and greatest technical and research opportunities related to sustainable chemistries.</AbstractNarration>
