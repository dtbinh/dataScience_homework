    <AbstractNarration>The objective of iNoVATE, a consortium of five colleges, an ATE Regional Center and the Florida Department of Education, is to develop a statewide technical certificate in Network Virtualization. Along with a curriculum framework, this project delivers student labs, faculty training, and summer programs to high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of this project are: (1) Develop, implement and disseminate curriculum for a Networking Virtualization statewide technical certificate; (2) Establish networking virtualization labs where students can access equipment to practice virtualization skills in-person or remotely; (3) Develop and deliver a series of Network Virtualization Train-the-Trainer faculty workshops and instructional resources; and (4) Create and deliver hands-on summer programs to help at least 100 high school students strengthen their math and science skills and increase their understanding of virtualization technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;iNoVATE's Network Virtualization certificate framework and the training program is shared by all 28 institutions in the Florida College System. The project team provides resources for each of the technical certificate courses and creates distance learning options for rural technician education. In addition, a series of workshops related to Network Virtualization increase faculty understanding of this emerging technology. Project outcomes are disseminated via the Center for Convergence Technology and its national network of partner colleges. Industry partners, Cisco, VMware and Citrix, contribute hardware and software, and they assist with modifying their existing curricula materials so they can be used by iNoVATE.</AbstractNarration>
