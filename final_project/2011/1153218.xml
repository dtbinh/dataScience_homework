    <AbstractNarration>The spider family Theraphosidae, commonly referred to as 'tarantulas', is the most diverse lineage among a group of spiders that includes trapdoor and funnel web spiders. Tarantulas are the world's largest spiders, can live for over 30 years and have decidedly infamous reputations. Despite their diversity and notoriety, theraphosid spiders are relatively understudied. The classification of tarantulas is in shambles and is widely regarded as 'a taxonomic and nomenclatural nightmare'; members of the family are morphologically similar, taxa have been described on the basis of only one or few specimens, and few studies have taken an evolution-based approach to classification. In this REVSYS project Jason Bond and Brent Hendrixson will carry out a three-year plan to stimulate a renaissance in theraphosid systematics by tackling the most diverse (90 species) and 'close to home' genus, Aphonopelma. As part of this study they will employ multiple types of character evidence (morphological and molecular) to enhance biodiversity documentation of the genus Aphonopelma through evolutionary, biogeographic, and alpha-taxonomic revisions, develop online taxonomic keys and tools, collect rare spiders through extensive fieldwork in North and Central America, and train students in basic biodiversity research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training the next generation of taxonomic and organismal expertise forms a thread that runs through this project's research endeavors. The educational goal will be to provide students comprehensive training in theraphosid systematics that involves research addressing fundamental conceptual issues in systematics, biodiversity conservation, and evolutionary biology. The computerization and outreach objectives of this project will greatly enhance general accessibility to theraphosid diversity and increase the visibility of these spiders to the general public. Finally, the unique life history characteristics of tarantulas, coupled with their extensive distribution throughout global biodiversity hotspots, makes this group an ideal model for conservation related studies and assessments.</AbstractNarration>
