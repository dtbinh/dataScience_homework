    <AbstractNarration>This proposal enables selected graduate students to attend annual professional meetings of the Society for Social Studies of Science. This society is the central meeting place and intellectual forum for those engaged in Science and Technology Studies and it is a welcoming place for graduate students: they not only see papers, they also present, and are connected with mentors who advise them on careers and intellectual matters. The maximum award for a graduate student is $750 for a domestic flight and $1000 for international, and all must be US students flying on US carriers. There is a competitive selection process and the students are required to provide follow-up documentation on their experience. This is the fourth iteration of this graduate student funding request; earlier ones have brought students into the field who are now leaders in education and innovation.</AbstractNarration>
