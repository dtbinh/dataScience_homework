    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the AIR proposal "Accelerating Deployment of Novel Alleles in Cotton" addresses the next essential steps for the translation of information regarding cotton gene function that is currently being developed under a NSF-PFI alliance into commercial products by identifying and utilizing genotype-specific single nucleotide polymorphism DNA markers ('SNPs') to facilitate the rapid and selective transfer of desirable alleles (traits) into superior cotton cultivars. The outcomes from the proposed work will strengthen the cotton innovation ecosystem, empowering a wide range of new ventures by both large enterprises and smaller enterprises that lack the resources to accomplish such innovation alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will impact the innovation ecosystem for cotton improvement in both short-term and long-term ways, also reducing barriers to entry by smaller enterprises both through technology development and engagement of a potential matching sponsor. The network of partners in the proposed work will be key to sustained transformation of enabling resources into economic benefits. Proposed activities are closely tied to strong training and outreach programs with a successful history of engaging groups under-represented in the sciences, and which benefit from major institutional and state commitments.</AbstractNarration>
