    <AbstractNarration>The observation that many closely related species differ in chromosome number and morphology has lead to the idea that chromosomal rearrangements (fusions, fissions, inversions, etc) may be contribute to reproductive isolation (the inability to interbreed). Recent evidence has linked certain types of chromosomal rearrangements (inversions) and the development of reproductive isolation. However, other types of common rearrangements, such as chromosomal fusions, have yet to be investigated in this capacity. The proposed studies will determine the importance of a chromosomal fusion to the development of reproductive isolation between two killifish in the genus Lucania. This will be accomplished using a three stage design. First a breeding design will create hybrids that vary in their possession of the fused chromosome. Second, these animals will be measured for several traits important in reproductive isolation. Third, the animals will be genotyped to determine if they possess the fused chromosome. This will allow for the detection of any relationship between reproductive isolation and the fused chromosome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of the first studies to empirically examine the effects of a chromosomal fusion on reproductive isolation between two recently diverged species. This project will impact the Lucania community through the development of new molecular markers as well as the creation of two linkage maps. Participation of undergraduates will continue to be a priority and will involve hands on behavioral and molecular experience. In addition, a student with disability will be invited to perform a related research project.</AbstractNarration>
