    <AbstractNarration>The challenges of Exascale computing suggest that a new model of computation is needed upon&lt;br/&gt;which a new framework for mass storage may be built. Such a model currently under development is the&lt;br/&gt;ParalleX model. ParalleX addresses Exascale parallelism by removing most (if not all) global&lt;br/&gt;synchronization and providing a natural means for programs to manage local dependencies that maintain&lt;br/&gt;consistency. In a similar manner, we propose to develop a model of parallel storage that achieves the&lt;br/&gt;desired semantics without global synchronization. At the same time, the model will adopt a new&lt;br/&gt;programmer interface that reflects this approach. This I/O model is named PXFS and is intended to be&lt;br/&gt;integrated with the ParalleX model of computation, both by providing an I/O model for ParalleX and by&lt;br/&gt;being defined in terms of ParalleX.&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the proposed research are to derive a new model of persistent mass storage that&lt;br/&gt;unifies it with active in-memory data and develop PXFS, a proof-of-concept file system to enable&lt;br/&gt;effective and scalable Exascale computing. The objectives of the proposed project are to describe the&lt;br/&gt;PXFS model in complete terms, develop an initial reference implementation integrated with the HPX&lt;br/&gt;implementation of ParalleX, and evaluate the model via the reference implementation.</AbstractNarration>
