    <AbstractNarration>Gannon University continues the Scholars of Excellence in Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS) scholarship program. Over the five-year grant period, the program supports 20 academically promising students per year. The goals of the SEECS program are to: 1) increase the enrollment of financially needy, academically talented students in engineering and computer science programs; 2) assist students through scholarships and rigorous academic support, and 3) foster professional development to prepare students for STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cornerstone of the program is the Professional and Personal Enrichment Seminars which offer a single, shared experience for all scholars. Developmental workshops build social, academic, and career skills. Organizational and leadership skills are developed through team activities, colloquium speakers and field trips. The seminar includes a service-learning team design activity. Paired with a community non-profit organization, the students identify and design a solution to a STEM-related problem to aid the organization. Such enrichment activities make students more aware of the role of STEM professionals and help them develop social and leadership skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project impacts are multifold: 1) to enhance the referral network and partnerships with the Erie City (PA) School District and local Talent Search programs; 2) to disseminate the program structure and successes as a model for implementation; 3) to empower students to provide STEM solutions to local non-profit organizations, and 4) to increase the involvement of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM professions.</AbstractNarration>
