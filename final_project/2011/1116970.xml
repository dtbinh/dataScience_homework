    <AbstractNarration>The next-generation wireless networks are targeted at supporting various applications such as voice, data, and multimedia. However, wireless channels are unreliable and the capacity of a wireless fading channel is time-varying, which may cause severe degradation to video/audio quality. Therefore, it is particularly challenging to design quality of service (QoS) assurance mechanisms and multimedia compression techniques for multimedia communication over wireless networks. This project aims to develop new theories and techniques for QoS assured multimedia communication over non-stationary wireless channels. To accomplish this goal, the following research tasks are conducted: 1) developing a novel evolutionary spectrum approach, which is able to accurately model the dynamics of general non-stationary fading channels; 2) developing QoS-assured sliding-mode congestion control and scheduling mechanisms for multimedia communication over non-stationary fading channels; and 3) developing gamma rate theory for causal rate control in source coding, and developing cross layer design to achieve both network friendliness and viewer friendliness for multimedia coding and transmission. Techniques developed in this project will fill some important gaps in fundamental understanding of QoS-assured multimedia communication over non-stationary wireless channels, and provide the theoretical underpinning for system design and algorithm implementation.</AbstractNarration>
