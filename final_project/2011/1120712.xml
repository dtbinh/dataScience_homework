    <AbstractNarration>The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory is offering a summer course on Frontiers and Techniques in Plant Science. This is a 3 week combined laboratory and lecture course for students ranging from advanced graduate student to faculty. Scientists come from universities, medical schools, research institutes and industry. Laboratory work includes projects using a wide variety of species, including model and agriculturally important plants such as maize, rice, Arabidopsis, tobacco and tomato, reflecting current research priorities in many US and international laboratories. The course allows students to take advantage of a wealth of technological resources applied to biological processes that are unique to plants. They will gain experience with recent advances in several systems, including genetic, genomic and comparative studies. The course is designed to fulfill a continuing demand within the academic community and industry for training in molecular and genetic approaches to plant science. The intention is (1) to teach state of the art techniques to scientists already involved in plant research so that they can apply these technologies to their own future research and (2) to introduce scientists familiar with microbial, animal or plant systems to cutting-edge research carried out by top plant biologists. The course consists of a rigorous lecture series, a hands-on laboratory and informal workshops on a variety of research tools. Speakers will provide both an overview of their specialty and an in-depth discussion of their work. These speakers will be experts in a variety of plant systems, and will bring a range of technical expertise to the course. The laboratory sessions provide an intensive training in modern techniques in plant biology and reinforce the lessons learned in lectures.</AbstractNarration>
