    <AbstractNarration>This grant will fund a workshop to be held on October 13-15, 2011 at the Advanced Photon Source designed to advance research in the general area of micromechanics of polycrystalline materials. In particular presentations will be given by international experts who: (i) conduct synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments, (ii) model material behaviors on various size scales, or (iii) design systems with significant structural material selection challenges. The purpose of the workshop is to establish contacts and promote synergy between specialists from these areas. The ultimate goal is to optimize the impact of the high value data that arise from the diffraction experiments and the computationally intense multiscale simulations. By determining the nature of the most relevant and timely studies that can currently be performed these results can serve as templates for future collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The societal benefits of the project should be significant. It is the hope of the organizers (Professor Robert Suter from Carnegie Mellon University, Dr. Ulrich Lienert from the Advanced Photon Source and the PI) that this workshop will nurture a research community around the theme of combining high energy x-ray diffraction with micromechanical modeling for an improved understanding of complex polycrystalline systems and for more sophisticated micromechanical models. For this reason, a group of young investigators will be invited to attend the workshop to understand the challenges and potential successes that may be realized by establishing careers within this area. The industrial speakers will introduce pertinent application-related challenges currently facing some of the nations most important manufacturers.</AbstractNarration>
