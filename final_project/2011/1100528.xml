    <AbstractNarration>The main goal of this research project is to study and develop validated approaches which can accurately and efficiently determine the responses of mostly linear but locally nonlinear and uncertain structural systems. The structural systems in civil, mechanical and aerospace engineering often encounter nonlinearities that are localized. For designs, control, and identification and health monitoring, such locally nonlinear systems are, however, numerically analyzed as if the whole systems were nonlinear. The numerical analyses of such nonlinear systems can be computationally demanding. To accomplish this goal, a novel model reduction strategy utilizing the Volterra convolution integrals will be examined to include time-varying local features and feedback characteristics, and the use of emerging computing architectures such as Graphics Processing Units will be investigated for efficient data processing. The computational approaches developed in the research will be validated through applications to a series of germane benchmark problems involving dynamic analyses, identification and control of base-isolated buildings, bridge with nonlinear bearings, and bridge stay cables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research results will enable engineers to efficiently design, identify, and optimize passive and semi-active nonlinear response control devices that are used for the mitigation of the impact of natural hazards. The research will also facilitate more efficient characterization of the impacts of structural system degradation. The project will give advanced training to graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Minnesota and University of Southern California through their involvements in the research project. The internal programs at both institutions will be utilized to recruit students from underrepresented backgrounds to work on this research project. For their wider utilization in future research and practice, the project findings will be disseminated to the broader technical community through demonstration modules developed for formal courses, conference presentations, and journal publications. The research will be integrated in the investigators' ongoing outreach activities involving elementary, middle and high school students to expose them to structural dynamics and engineering design problems involving uncertainty.</AbstractNarration>
