    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to develop methods to improve biomechanical modeling by providing greater understanding of the effects of variations and uncertainty in model inputs. The study will focus on the process of developing computational models of the knee joint to study conditions such as risks for osteoarthritis. The approach will more efficiently account for uncertainty in model inputs such as tissue material properties and loading conditions and anatomic variations between individuals. By adapting robust design tools commonly used in other disciplines to the types of unknowns and variations seen in biomechanical models, the study will clarify how to identify the relative importance of different sources of variation in achieving a model that accurately predicts the clinical conditions. The method will be tested by comparing various simplified models to a set of highly subject-specific models. The award will also develop interactive teaching modules related to biomechanical modeling, statistical methods and experimental design for two engineering courses and a high school outreach program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this study will allow investigators to more efficiently decide where to focus their attention in the development of computational biomechanical models. Although the goal will be to provide a process for development of any biomechanical model, our test cases will be models for the investigation of factors such as obesity, in the risk for osteoarthritis. With this method, it will be possible to select the minimum clinical measurements necessary to adequately test specific hypotheses. This has the potential to reduce time, cost and risk to the subjects or patients. The educational impact of this program will be to introduce students to the impacts of uncertainty in the context of interesting biomechanical questions, and to broadly disseminate interactive teaching modules for others to use in undergraduate and high school outreach programs.</AbstractNarration>
