    <AbstractNarration>The International Conference for Supercomputing (ICS) brings together experts from diverse fields, including parallel application writers, libraries and tools developers, compiler developers, computer architects, and programming languages experts. The conference solicits papers on all aspects of research, development, and application of large-scale, high-performance experimental and commercial systems. In 2011 the conference will be held May 31 - June 4, 2011 in Tucson, Arizona.&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to offer up to 10 NSF-sponsored student travel and junior faculty (without travel support) grants for a total budget of $10,000. Applications will be solicited via email mailing lists, personal contacts, and the conference web site. The selection process will consider the applicant?s level of participation in ICS, followed by how closely the student?s research interests match areas covered by ICS.</AbstractNarration>
