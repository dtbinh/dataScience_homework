    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1103368&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Yongbin Ruan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the past twenty years, there has been a great deal of&lt;br/&gt;interaction between mathematic and physics. Various&lt;br/&gt;correspondences or dualities arising from physics have had a&lt;br/&gt;great impact on mathematics. One of these correspondences is the&lt;br/&gt;Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence. This proposal offers a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive program to establish this correspondence in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics with mathematical rigor. There is a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;applications such as global mirror symmetry, the computation of&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, and to&lt;br/&gt;modular forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the era of Newton, mathematics has been a key tool in&lt;br/&gt;helping us to comprehend the universe. An example is&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry via Einstein's theory of general&lt;br/&gt;relativity. During the last twenty years there has been a great&lt;br/&gt;deal of activity in building so-called string-theoretic models of&lt;br/&gt;the universe. The string-theoretic model of the universe is&lt;br/&gt;ten-dimensional, our usual 4-dimensional space-time togeher with&lt;br/&gt;a very small 6-dimensional space called a Calabi-Yau manifold.&lt;br/&gt;Such a small internal space will affect our space-time through&lt;br/&gt;certain mathematical quantities such as Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;invariants. The computation of these invariants has been a&lt;br/&gt;central problem in geometry and physics. This is the area in&lt;br/&gt;which mathematical tools can be very useful. The current&lt;br/&gt;proposal envisages a theoretical framework as well as developing&lt;br/&gt;technical tools to compute Gromov-Witten invariants</AbstractNarration>
