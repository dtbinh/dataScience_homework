    <AbstractNarration>1156307/ Boriek&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER award funded by the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering Program will use engineering tools to explore a novel and controverial hypothesis about the mechanism of signal transduction in smooth muscle cells. The hypothesis involves the role of the cytoskeleton in regulating mechanosensing genes in these cells. Exploratory data generated from the proposed experiments in this developmental research project could provide for the first time fundamental innovative information on a novel signaling role of specific cytoskeletal elements in the regulation of the silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1) in smooth muscle cells. The research will engage an interdisciplinary team of experts in bioengineering, physiology, biophysics, and molecular biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long term objective of the work is to contribute to the understanding of the molecular physiological mechanisms modulating airway smooth muscle dysfunction in asthma, and to uncover innovative molecular mechanisms that could potentially alter interventional approaches for preventing and treating asthma. Results from the proposed EAGER may provide novel exploratory data that could potentially contribute to guide interventional approaches for preventing and treating asthma, and improve the quality of life in asthmatics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will integrate research and education in science, molecular biology, and biochemistry, and physiology by directly engaging undergraduate, graduate, and possibly medical students. It will encourage students to participate as well as organize scientific&lt;br/&gt;meetings. The PI will attract undergraduates through Baylor College of Medicine SMART Program that supports under-represented students to pursue research careers initially as undergraduates. The PI will also contribute to the training of graduate students at the interface between engineering, biology and medicine.</AbstractNarration>
