    <AbstractNarration>The University of Northern Iowa has been granted an NSF award to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site (REU): The Interdisciplinary Research Experience in Hyperspectral Imaging (IDREHSI). The goal of this project is to introduce young scientists to a highly interdisciplinary research environment with a unifying theme of fundamental and applied research in hyperspectral imaging (HI) in eight different STEM disciplines. Recent technological developments and the increased availability of laboratory, satellite, and airborne-based HI imagery has led to a growing demand for HI-related jobs which calls for greater learning, understanding and use of hyperspectral imaging for various applications. Given the advantages of HI, REU students will have opportunities to engage in HI-based research in geographic information science, earth science, environmental science, physics, biology, computer science, and atmospheric science for different applications such as mapping and modeling of land use/land cover, minerals, soils and geologic features, water resources, wetland, forestry, and precision agriculture. The participants will: (1) be exposed to existing scientific approaches and experimental methods in HI, (2) develop skills that make students competitive in academic and professional environments, (3) be involved in faculty-mentored scientific investigations that prepares them for graduate studies and/or professional careers, (4) operate in highly interdisciplinary research settings and work across disciplinary boundaries in problem-based research, (5) improve their capability for learning independently, and (6) provide opportunities to discuss ethical issues related to collection and use of data, experimental design, and professional standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
