    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests partial support for participation of students and young researchers&lt;br/&gt;in the 36th Annual International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves.&lt;br/&gt;The conference will be held in Houston TX on October 2-7, 2011. NSF support will provide&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for young researchers to showcase their recent results and interact with experts&lt;br/&gt;in the various disciplines which fall within the conference scope. The requested funds will&lt;br/&gt;specifically be used to support travel and registration costs for US researchers, and will&lt;br/&gt;be targeted towards under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;This conference has recently grown rapidly and is now the leading forum for researchers in&lt;br/&gt;all areas of long-wave electromagnetic science and technology. Topical areas span a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of disciplines, including aspects of physics, chemistry, biology and numerous engineering&lt;br/&gt;disciplines. The conference continues to benefit from the technical co-sponsorship of the&lt;br/&gt;IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society, which oversees the publication of the conference&lt;br/&gt;proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposal is fostering an environment of technical discussions among&lt;br/&gt;numerous different communities of theorists and practicing scientists and engineers. In addition&lt;br/&gt;the conference organizers are dedicated to encouraging participation by young US scientists&lt;br/&gt;and researchers, especially from under-represented groups. This will be accomplished through&lt;br/&gt;reduced conference registration fees for students as well as by providing targeted travel&lt;br/&gt;support enabled by this NSF proposal. By fostering the careers of younger researchers, this&lt;br/&gt;proposal will benefit the future growth of the field of long-wave science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
