    <AbstractNarration>PI: Pepper&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1148579 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this conference is to provide for travel support to the International Symposium on Advances in Computational Heat Transfer (CHT?12) to be held in July 2012 in Bath, United Kingdom. This is an international conference on state-of-the-art and promising computational techniques applied to heat transfer, and will assemble scientists and engineers working in fields related to, and requiring, computational methods for modeling all modes of heat transfer, including coupling with fluid flow and related multi-physics interactions. The goal of the symposium is to bring together leading researchers in the field of computational hardware and software and foster a technical exchange of ideas for future activities in the field. Software innovation for the next generation of scientists will be a key feature of the discussion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The conference spans the spectrum of application in thermal sciences but with scientific computing at its core. Therefore advances in computing software is likely to impact many disciplines, and at the same time application needs can be communicated to those developing software. The conference support allows US scientists to be engaged in a major international conference and make connections for collaborative activities.</AbstractNarration>
