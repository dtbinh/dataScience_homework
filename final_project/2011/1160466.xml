    <AbstractNarration>The aim of this project is to investigate some instances of the theory of derived categories of coherent sheaves.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the P.I. has three main objectives:&lt;br/&gt;(1) To study the geometry of moduli spaces of complexes for the projective plane, K3 surfaces and cubic 4-folds.&lt;br/&gt;(2) To realize ``classical'' questions and conjectures in enumerative geometry as wall-crossing phenomena in derived category, the starting example being the total space of the canonical bundle over the projective plane.&lt;br/&gt;(3) To give a complete description of equivalences between the derived categories of K3 surfaces and of their deformations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader context of this project is the area of algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;Starting as a pure mathematical subject, in the recent years algebraic geometry has seen many interactions with other areas of science.&lt;br/&gt;The present project is motivated and inspired precisely by connections, envisioned by the Fields Medal winner M. Kontsevich almost twenty years ago, with theoretical physics and string theory.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, by bringing intuition and techniques from physics to tackle classical problems in pure mathematics and, vice versa, to provide mathematical rigorous foundations to physics constructions.</AbstractNarration>
