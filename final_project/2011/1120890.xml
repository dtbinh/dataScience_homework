    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this Scalable NanoManufacturing (SNM) project is to develop a scalable and inexpensive process for manufacturing integrated systems of DNA constructed nanodevices and metamaterials. Structural DNA nanotechnology is unique in its ability to arrange nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, proteins, quantum dots, and metal nanoparticles into arbitrary varieties of rationally designed nanoscale geometries. Some such structures have already demonstrated potential as sensors, transistors, optical components, nanomechanical manipulators, and experimental platforms for basic science. Because DNA nanostructures are self-assembled, it is possible in principle to cheaply produce large quantities of future nanodevices for widespread technological application. The key challenge is the integration of these devices into functioning systems in a way that is compatible with mass manufacturing. At present, there is no viable technological vision for doing so, very limited pertinent knowledge regarding the issues and challenges, and limited efforts in addressing these problems by researchers in the field. The aim is to remedy this situation by combining the development of more versatile DNA based nanostructures with the exploration of entirely novel concepts for electronically monitoring and controlling the assembly of DNA nanostructure arrays. Another aim is to improve qualitatively our ability to interface DNA nanostructures with functional nanoscale materials and provide powerful new ways to monitor and guide DNA based self-assembly. This project is based on DNA nanostructures that will undergo surface initiated self-assembly into much larger 2D and 3D arrays. The long term vision is a bench-top factory, in which functional nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and proteins are assembled with the help of DNA into high quality nanostructures arranged according to a macroscale system layout. Assembly will be monitored both electronically and optically to allow real time assembly optimization and error control. The finished product will be printed onto low cost substrates for sophisticated functions such as disease diagnosis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project includes cost-effective manufacturing of large scale functional nanomaterials, as well as a comprehensive education and outreach program including the mentoring of graduate students, undergraduates and K-12 students, including underrepresented groups. In addition to direct mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students, the PIs have a strong record of outreach activities, which will be continued and expanded during the proposal work period. This includes participation in programs to engage high school teachers in research related activities (UCR), playing a vital role in Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) and Minorities in Mathematics, Science, and Engineering (MSE) programs at Caltech, and involving high school students in nanotechnology research and close collaboration with scientifically-oriented arts and entertainment groups (NYU).</AbstractNarration>
