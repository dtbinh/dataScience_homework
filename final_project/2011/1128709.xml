    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to develop a family of microphotonic waveguides and devices, based on insights in spatial mode interference, absorption and scattering, that enable new degrees of freedom in photonic device design with ultra-low optical loss. Low loss is achieved using a form of photonic collision avoidance that keeps optical fields away from scatterers using controlled interference. The program will investigate this phenomenon and employ it to develop potentially transformative microphotonic waveguide and device technology, including energy efficient planar waveguide crossing arrays, modulators, and suspended light-force-actuated and thermooptic photonics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research includes the investigation of a newly discovered mode of propagation, low-loss unidirectional Bloch waves, and the design of efficient photonic, electrooptic and optomechanical devices based on their properties to circumvent limitations in state-of-the-art technology. The research will produce a theoretical framework for device design, simulation tools, and proof-of-concept experimental demonstrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work will support national efforts on leadership in science and technology. Proposed devices will enable highly energy efficient optical interconnects uniquely compatible with photonics integration directly with state-of-the-art, unmodified CMOS electronics technology. This may contribute advances in microelectronics and hybrid electronic-photonic technology for high-performance computing, supporting the national interest in large-scale simulation including climate modeling, aerodynamic design, bioengineering and drug design, and financial market simulations. The program will expose undergraduate students to research, and through local visits will excite high school students about engineering with energy efficiency concepts from this research, and more broadly, including solar vehicle racing.</AbstractNarration>
