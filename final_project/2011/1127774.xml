    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award is for the timely deployment of University of New Hampshire (UNH) personnel and equipment as part of a joint NOAA-University field campaign (Nitrogen, Aerosol Composition and Halogens on a Tall Tower - NACHTT) to take place during the winter/spring transition of 2011, at a rural site in Colorado (Boulder Atmospheric Observatory, Erie, CO). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NACHTT campaign has as its goals the further investigation of the activation of photolabile halogens species, such as may generate chlorine radicals, by surface reactions on nitrogen oxide aerosol particles. Speciated volatile organic compound (VOC) analyses proposed by UNH researchers serves two distinct purposes, namely:&lt;br/&gt;i) providing an independent check on the extent of halogen oxidation occurring at the NACHTT study site, along with potential diagnostic information of the type and source of air masses found at the site&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ii) taking advantage of an extensive suite of key nitrogen, aerosol and halogen species measured during NACHTT for tracing the winter/spring reactivity of monoterpene hydrocarbons, a class of naturally produced biogenic hydrocarbons whose gas-phase oxidation may lead to secondary products such as aromatic hydrocarbons and organic aerosol species , typically attributed to man-made pollution sources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first of these objectives contributes to the broader NACHTT measurement campaign. The second will lead to a further understanding of both the seasonality of biogenic VOC emissions at a rural, mind-continental site, along with their potential subsequent oxidation .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNH graduate students will be involved in the field sampling, measurement, data reduction and synthesis aspects of the study. The outcome of the measurements will be explained to and made available to the public and other investigators through the UNH AIRMAP website.</AbstractNarration>
