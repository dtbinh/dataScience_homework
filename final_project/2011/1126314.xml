    <AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approach&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to investigate applications of optical frequency combs in photonic signal processing and atomic-molecular-optical (AMO) physics. The approach is to acquire a state of the art, commercial frequency comb laser to enable new experimental studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ultrafast photonics the frequency comb will enable generation of optical and radio-frequency signals with instantaneous bandwidth and long-term jitter properties significantly better than available by conventional technologies. In AMO physics research, the frequency comb will enable driving coherent optical transitions involving very different transition frequencies, and will be an invaluable tool, for example, to create ground state molecules via photoassociation for current research aiming to use such molecules for quantum computing. Furthermore, the proposed equipment is expected to catalyze new interdisciplinary collaborations involving both disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed equipment will provide rich opportunities for broad student training in areas of cutting-edge technology and enable new research impacting optical and wireless communications, both areas with direct societal impact, and quantum computing, an emerging area with potential for revolutionary impact in the long term. Broader impact is also anticipated through a variety of activities in which the proposing faculty are engaged. For example, Weiner is currently Chair of the National Academy of Engineering?s Frontiers of Engineering conference, considered to be an important career development opportunity for future engineering leaders, while Elliott is active in diversity issues, as evidenced by his term as Director of Graduate Recruitment and Retention Programs at Purdue?s College of Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
