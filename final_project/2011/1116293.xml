    <AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Wecoma, a 185? general purpose research vessel operated by Oregon State University as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The vessel is owned by the National Science Foundation. The request includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) GPS Based Network Time Server&lt;br/&gt;2) Multicorer Refurbishment&lt;br/&gt;3) Acoustic Testing on R/V WECOMA&lt;br/&gt;4) Double-Rate Pingers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researcher.</AbstractNarration>
