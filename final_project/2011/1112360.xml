    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Gregory S. Girolami of the Department of Chemistry of the University of Illinois will explore the synthesis of several classes of molecular precursors for electronic materials. The project involves the synthesis of new compounds, investigations of their chemical reactivities, and studies of their volatilities and utilities as thin film precursors. Some of the specific objectives of the current project are the development of volatile two-coordinate amido complexes of the late transition elements, and mechanistic studies of dealkylation reactions that are relevant both to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and to the chemistry of dialkylamide ligands. In parallel, investigations of new CVD precursors for both metal borides and metal oxides will be carried out, using a new class of chelating borohydride ligands of the general formula NR2(BH3)2-. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve training undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, and broadening participation through the inclusion of researchers from underrepresented groups on the project. This work could lead to the development of better molecular precursors for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) growth of thin films. Such chemistry will have an impact on critical problems in the microelectronics industry, and could lead to faster and more capable microprocessors for computers and other electronic equipment. In addition, this project will provide excellent training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
