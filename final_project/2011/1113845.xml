    <AbstractNarration>The Dynamic Spectrum Markets Workshop will be held on June 2-3, 2011, at Northwestern University. This workshop will bring together experts in wireless networking, wireless communications, economics and public policy to address the design and deployment of dynamic markets for improving the utilization of wireless spectrum. Topics to be covered in the workshop include the technical advances that could better facilitate spectrum markets, the technical restrictions that should be placed on spectrum users, and the type of market mechanisms that are appropriate for running such a market. The expected outcome of the workshop would be to establish a multidisciplinary research agenda for designing future dynamic spectrum markets, and contribute to the development of techniques for enhancing the access to radio spectrum and better supporting current and new applications. Participants will be selected based on an open call for white papers as well as there being invited participants.</AbstractNarration>
