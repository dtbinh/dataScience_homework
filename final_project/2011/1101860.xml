    <AbstractNarration>This award lends support to solidify a new self-organized group "Biopolymer Biophysics Inside a Cell" to hold a subgroup symposium at the upcoming Annual Meeting of the Biophysical Society. This group emerged at the last Annual Meeting of the Biophysical Society in March 2010 in San Francisco. The emerging group is composed of biophysicists interested in communicating ideas about using interdisciplinary biophysical approaches in better understanding of biopolymer biophysics inside a cell. Understanding the properties of macromolecules under volume constraints is viewed as an important and developing area that is likely to attract top-young biophysicists in the future and have a wide-range of intellectual impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The speakers are top researchers from around the world. The level of the talks will be accessible to attendees of the Biophysical Society Annual meeting in 2011, Baltimore, Maryland, including graduate students and undergraduates. This new subgroup will promote research on biopolymer biophysics inside cells tackled from fields including experiment, theory and computer simulation. Presently, this emerging and important field does not have good representation by women and minorities. One of the nine speakers is a woman. In an effort to reach out to junior researchers who are an important group of future scientists in this emerging field, particularly women and minority students, travel awards will be presented to junior researchers who submit the best abstracts and posters.</AbstractNarration>
