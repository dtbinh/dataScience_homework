    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I research proposal proposes research to develop an ultra-compact, low cost&lt;br/&gt;system for wirelessly monitoring motors that will cost manufacturers less than $300/ motor&lt;br/&gt;to implement. The research will leverage existing patent-pending energy-efficient&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for determining motor condition based on vibration and temperature data to develop&lt;br/&gt;wireless nodes capable of autonomously determining the condition of any motor to which they&lt;br/&gt;are attached. The research will result in a prototype system of wireless nodes implemented&lt;br/&gt;at an industrial partner, which will provide the necessary incentive for future investment&lt;br/&gt;in the company and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research will be to enable a wireless system to facilitate&lt;br/&gt;condition-based maintenance of electric motors in industrial facilities at a cost of less&lt;br/&gt;than $300 per motor to manufacturers, which is about 10% of the cost of current systems.&lt;br/&gt;At this price point, tens of thousands of facilities around the United States will be able&lt;br/&gt;to afford the initial investment to implement condition-based maintenance on their motor systems.&lt;br/&gt;Since condition-based maintenance has been shown to maximize up-time and minimize yearly maintenance&lt;br/&gt;costs, this will increase the competitiveness of American manufacturing and ultimately&lt;br/&gt;help create more manufacturing sector jobs. Additionally, the prototype system produced as&lt;br/&gt;a result of the research will provide an important proof-of-concept for low-cost, low-power&lt;br/&gt;wireless sensor nodes that should help spur future development and investment in this field,&lt;br/&gt;which is in turn instrumental for the development of "smart grids", "smart cities", and other&lt;br/&gt;intelligent infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
