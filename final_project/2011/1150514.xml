    <AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: This project seeks to formulate a clear and consistent interpretation of &lt;br/&gt;optical dynamics so that field interactions with matter can be confidently modeled in a &lt;br/&gt;manner previously impossible. Such will enable educators to teach modern &lt;br/&gt;electrodynamics with confidence and allow for the development of applications involving &lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic fields. In pursuit of this goal, the specific aim of the proposed project is &lt;br/&gt;to answer, within the framework of classical electrodynamics, the questions ?how do we &lt;br/&gt;express with confidence the dynamics of complex material systems subject to &lt;br/&gt;optical/electromagnetic forces?? and ?how are the various models of electromagnetic &lt;br/&gt;forces and momentum interrelated?? This new interpretation will be applied to evaluate &lt;br/&gt;emerging and proposed technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research will provide the background necessary for modeling &lt;br/&gt;complex systems where electromagnetic fields are used for self-assembly and in situ &lt;br/&gt;control of photonic structures and will additionally benefit biology and medicine where &lt;br/&gt;optical forces are currently used to probe the mechanical properties of living cells. &lt;br/&gt;Applications focus on efficient and sustainable use of resources and include the use of &lt;br/&gt;optical matter for fabricating nanophotonic structures for various applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This grant will assist in advancing technology developments in &lt;br/&gt;Arkansas through a collaborative effort with other grants and contracts to build regional &lt;br/&gt;centers of excellence, which will promote new innovation while encouraging small &lt;br/&gt;business development. This work also proposes to improve how engineering education &lt;br/&gt;treats field interactions with matter, an approach that will have a fundamental impact on &lt;br/&gt;the preparedness of next generation engineers.</AbstractNarration>
