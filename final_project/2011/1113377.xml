    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has the goal of creating a signal amplification system that, while being inexpensive and simple to use, can be combined with antibodies or other probe molecules, and can increase detection limits of conventional ELISAs by 100- to 1000-fold, or even higher. To prove the concept, it is proposed to apply this system to rabbit antibodies and demonstrate that, in combination with rabbit antibodies raised against botulinum neurotoxin A, it will be able to provide sensitivity of detection similar to that of immuno-PCR, but at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this research is expected in the areas of basic research, biodefense, and medicine. This system will allow very sensitive and inexpensive detection of antigens of choice. For those involved in basic research, the proposed immunoassay will allow a significantly more detailed analysis of biological processes, possibly even opening the doors to monitoring those processes and molecules previously undetectable. In biodefense and medical diagnostics, increased sensitivity will mean an increased security by allowing earlier detection of harmful pathogens, as well as pathological change.</AbstractNarration>
