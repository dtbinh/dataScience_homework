    <AbstractNarration>Netcentric Software and Systems Center&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1128344&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1128270&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Netcentric Software and Systems Center sites at the University of North Texas and the University of Texas ? Dallas. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-601. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software development is increasingly achieved via Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) served through web-based services, Quality of Service (QoS) is an important issue yet major gaps exist in the QoS paradigm. The proposed work looks at the composition approach where QoS properties are known at the individual web component level and used to determine an overall global QoS understanding. The proposed work seeks to establish a comprehensive framework for QoS-assured service composition and execution using a A QoS-reconfigurable service paradigm, compositional security and reliability analysis recently developed by the group, and a three phase composition algorithm to rapidly arrive at candidate compositions that meet QoA requirements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the proposed work have the potential for significant impact in the area of software development and application and the SOA community. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center. The effort has the potential to extend the center?s portfolio through further development and application of the QoS framework developed. The PI plans to develop Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium (NCOIC) patterns from the work and post these for public access. The center will involve graduate students in the work.</AbstractNarration>
