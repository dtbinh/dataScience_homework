    <AbstractNarration>This research funds work in economic theory. The goal is to develop a new approach to the mechanism design for applications in which the mechanism designer/proposer has private information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous research on mechanism design by a privately informed individual is based on modeling assumptions that exclude many market environments. This new research effort does not use these restrictive assumptions, so the new theory is applicable to a much broader range of real world situations. The researchers (1) examine equilibrium uniqueness in the resulting game; (2) compare the different solution concepts previously developed by other researchers to determine if these concepts actually give the same solution in a specific class of games. (3)Use the new approach to analyze applications to multi unit auctions and labor supply contracts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insights from basic research into the principles of effective mechanism design are yielding substantial benefit to society as a whole. New market designs are bringing buyers and sellers together in new ways.</AbstractNarration>
