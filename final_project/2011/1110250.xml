    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will harness the popularity and ubiquity of mobile microgames on hand-held devices for educating children on self-management of chronic health conditions. Millions of children suffer from chronic conditions which require regular management, including asthma, diabetes, and food allergies. Children are less likely to adhere to proper medication and behaviors to manage their disease, and thus are more likely to be hospitalized for health emergencies that could have been avoided with proper management. This proposal aims to educate children via engaging, interactive microgames that train children to monitor and manage their chronic condition. The research objectives for this grant are to build and design a working prototype asthma education game for the iPod Touch and evaluate the game's usability and appeal among the target users. The project should result in an effective game that improves children's understanding of their condition and adherence to healthy behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed project include improving the health of children with chronic health conditions. The project will aim to help children with a broad array of health conditions, and will improve their knowledge on self-management behaviors (monitoring blood glucose levels, taking inhalers, avoiding nuts, etc.) so that children stay healthier and avoid hospitalization. These microgames can be built for a variety of hand-held devices, including mobile phones and digital music players, which allows for wide-spread adoption and use among today's technologically-adept youth.</AbstractNarration>
