    <AbstractNarration>Researchers will conduct a modern and novel taxonomic treatment of a hyper-diverse group of early land plants the liverwort genus Frullania. Liverworts (Marchantiophyta) are pivotal in our understanding of early land plant evolution and exist as important components of the vegetation in many regions of the world. The project represents an unprecedented investigation of this scale on a leafy liverwort genus, so-called because of the leafy plant structure. Taxonomic conclusions will be drawn from a multi-faceted data set, including morphology, fieldwork, experimental growth studies, as well as DNA sequence data, and population studies using DNA microsatellite markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Importantly, the project will extensively utilize computer and web-based tools to help furnish biodiversity data to biologists, ecologists, conservationists, and the public. The project continues strong partnerships with international databasing activities such as the Encyclopedia of Life. The project provides critical training to young scientists in museum collections-based research. Unique to the project is the development of a strong network of institutions, participating in Service to Science and Service Learning programs bridging science and training. The project has a strong outreach strategy including pod and video casts, contributing to Plants of the World Educator Guide, and participation in the Educator Open House, including over 300 Chicago-area educators. The scientists involves in this research will also provide a liverwort identification field course.</AbstractNarration>
