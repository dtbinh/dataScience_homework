    <AbstractNarration>This award will support an observational project to explore the nature of cool ("red") binary and multiple stars. The project adopts a two-pronged approach to uncover both close binaries and those with wide separation. The main goals of the project are to reveal important clues about star formation, improve knowledge of the luminosity and mass functions of individual and multiple red dwarfs, provide samples for studies of the longevity of wide multiples in the solar neighborhood, and evaluate whether multiplicity affects the formation of exoplanets around red dwarfs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to shed light on the process of star formation and how binary and multiple systems evolve with time. The research will also contribute to the education and training of students from a variety of backgrounds, and non-scientists will benefit from opportunities to participate in this project.</AbstractNarration>
