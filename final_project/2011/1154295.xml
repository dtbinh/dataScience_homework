    <AbstractNarration>This North Carolina State University project: Research Scholars Program in Mathematics is a continuation of their existing and effective four year S-STEM grant. The current project intends to provide scholarships to six undergraduates and eight graduate students in mathematics. The focus of the program will be on junior and senior undergraduates and graduate students in their first two years of study with special attention being paid to members of underrepresented groups. Particularly noteworthy is that all scholars, both undergraduate and graduate, will have the opportunity to be involved in either research or an internship. Additionally, scholars will attend weekly Professional Development Modules (where they will learn skills such as LaTex, Matlab, PowerPoint, etc.) and monthly seminars and will be mentored individually by a faculty member. The Research Scholars Program infrastructure can be adapted to other disciplines and will benefit not only students at NCSU, but can also impact the discipline of mathematics itself.</AbstractNarration>
