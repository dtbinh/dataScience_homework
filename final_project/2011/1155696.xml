    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the organization and conduct of the International Conference on Methods for Surveying and Enumerating Hard-to-Reach Populations (a.k.a., the H2R Conference), scheduled to be held in New Orleans in October 2012. Surveying hard-to-reach populations is a problem of increasing importance. The concept of who qualifies as "hard to reach" is shifting. In addition to historically undercounted groups such as racial and ethnic minorities, new research suggests that additional hard-to-reach groups are emerging. These include cell phone-only households, an increase in "hidden" populations pushed out of the mainstream by new immigration-related policies, and a growing percentage in the general population who are cynical about surveys and censuses due to data breaches, identify theft, privacy concerns, and mistrust of government. Moreover, in the U.S., Europe, and many other nations, the population continues to diversify due to immigration. This diversification has produced an increase in the composition and complexity of racial and ethnic minorities, which in turn create barriers such as linguistic isolation, lack of acculturation, and a general lack of familiarity and trust in surveys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring together survey methodologists, sociologists, statisticians, demographers, ethnographers, policy analysts, and other professionals from around the world to present new and innovative concepts and techniques for surveying hard-to reach-populations. In doing so, it will address both the statistical and survey design aspects of including hard-to-reach groups. The conference program will be available on the conference web site prior to the conference, and the conference proceedings will be available on the web site shortly after the conference. In addition, a special monograph will be produced from invited conference papers.</AbstractNarration>
