    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: This CalWomenTech Scale Up Project (CWT Scale Up Project) is based on the successful, five-year GSE Extension Services grant. The original project worked with eight community college technology programs in California to increase the number of women recruited and retained to STEM programs in which they were underrepresented. The project also disseminated research-based proven strategies and resources to California educators and a limited national audience. The CalWomenTech Project has resulted in significant increases in the enrollment of female students and in the retention of both female and male students. The CWT Scale Up Project seeks to diffuse the core activities of the intensive CalWomenTech Project to a much larger audience of educational practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CWT Scale Up Project is based on research: both the CalWomenTech Project's own successful outcomes and on a literature review of the proven practices of other STEM practitioners, much of which can be found in IWITTS' online Proven Practices Collection (includes peer-reviewed articles, case studies, and webinars) developed by the CalWomenTech Project. Objectives include providing educational practitioners with workshops, webinars, and group coaching on recruitment and retention plan implementation, along with development of an online learning community. A professionally designed outreach campaign by an experienced social media networking consultant will feature CalWomenTech successful results, professional development opportunities, and the online Proven Practices Collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The end goal of the CalWomenTech Scale Up Project is to increase the number of women in STEM. Our nation is enriched when women fully contribute to the advancement of science and technology. By giving practitioners nationwide the tools and knowledge they need to close the gender gap for women and girls in STEM classrooms, the CalWomenTech Scale Up Project has the power to change the lives and livelihoods of women for the benefit of all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Advanced Technology Education program.</AbstractNarration>
