    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Christopher Reed of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Riverside will explore the extremes of cation chemistry by utilizing the most stable, least basic, least coordinating anion - the perfluorinated carborane anion. The conjugate acid of this anion may be the world's strongest acid. It should be a strong enough acid to add H+ to some of the most weakly basic molecules, ones that have not been protonated before (e.g. Xe). The acid will also be explored as a novel catalyst for acid-catalyzed reactions such the room temperature cracking of hydrocarbons and the decomposition of halocarbons and freons. There are potential uses in the remediation of halocarbon chemical waste, converting it into useful hydrocarbons fuels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research include the possibility that new knowledge about cations, acidity and inert anions will impact commercially important areas such as petroleum reforming, polymerization catalysis, battery technology and fuel cell technology. The grant is primarily a vehicle for student training in research. UC Riverside has a high population of students from traditionally under-represented groups (e.g. Hispanics) so this project provides excellent opportunities for involving them in frontline chemical research and attracting them to careers in science.</AbstractNarration>
