    <AbstractNarration>1159540&lt;br/&gt;Ramasamy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop an electrochemical biosensing system to detect a volatile&lt;br/&gt;compound released by plants. The volatile chemical signature of plants carries unique&lt;br/&gt;information that can be helpful in the identification of the state-of-heath of the plant. Detection of&lt;br/&gt;this signature can advance our understanding of the ?plant language? and will eventually help in&lt;br/&gt;the development of real-time health monitoring systems for large-scale agriculture. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed work integrates material science, biochemistry and electrochemistry to develop a&lt;br/&gt;nanostructured platform for amperometric biosensing. Successful completion of the proposed&lt;br/&gt;work will result in a novel bi-enzyme based electrochemical biosensor with tunable properties.&lt;br/&gt;The hybrid composite nanomaterial interfaces to be developed in this project will provide&lt;br/&gt;multiple benefits and can be applied to other bio-electrochemical systems. The proposed work&lt;br/&gt;will directly impact the field of agriculture and forestry. The project will also have broader&lt;br/&gt;influence in the development of enzyme-based biosensors. The proposed project will provide&lt;br/&gt;education and training for graduate and undergraduate students and post-docs. Results from&lt;br/&gt;the project will be broadly disseminated through conference presentations, seminars and&lt;br/&gt;scientific publications. The proposed outreach activities will provide a social impact on the high&lt;br/&gt;school students in the state of Georgia.</AbstractNarration>
