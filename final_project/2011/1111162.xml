    <AbstractNarration>To increase the number of graduate students and postdocs entering the professoriate in STEM disciplines,&lt;br/&gt;the Leadership Alliance, a national consortium of higher education institutions, in conjunction with its&lt;br/&gt;member institutions, Brown University and Columbia University, and in collaboration with four minority&lt;br/&gt;serving institutions - Dillard University, Howard University, Morgan State University, and Spelman&lt;br/&gt;College - will design, pilot, and rigorously evaluate activities to foster professional development, &lt;br/&gt;skills-building, mentoring, and career training. The activities of this project consist of (i) conducting a&lt;br/&gt;baseline needs analysis of the diversity efforts at Brown and Columbia to better understand issues and&lt;br/&gt;barriers to establishing a sustainable institutional culture of diversity; (ii) investigating incentive&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms to promote the engagement of participating departmental faculty and administrators in the&lt;br/&gt;proposed mentoring and professional development activities to provide a supportive environment that&lt;br/&gt;fosters successful outcomes; (iii) and identifying effective strategies to develop and implement mentoring,&lt;br/&gt;skills-building and professional development opportunities for underrepresented graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral fellows.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide the first systematic effort to: (i) identify the professional development and career training needs of STEM graduate students and postdocs from underrepresented groups at leading research&lt;br/&gt;institutions; (ii) evaluate best practices in training of doctoral students and postdocs; (iii) assess the&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness of a comprehensive program of professional development workshops on the mentoring and&lt;br/&gt;skills-building of STEM graduate students and postdocs from underrepresented groups. The&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive, multi-faceted evaluation efforts of these interventions that employ the expertise of STEM&lt;br/&gt;faculty members, senior administrators, an external evaluator, graduate students and postdocs from both&lt;br/&gt;research-intensive and minority-serving institutions will provide a foundation upon which to design&lt;br/&gt;novel, relevant and effective best practices, resources and initiatives that will prepare underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;minority STEM graduate students and postdocs for the 21st century professoriate.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project supplements earlier efforts to expand the pipeline of scholars from underrepresented groups&lt;br/&gt;in STEM disciplines, which focus on pre-collegiate and undergraduate students. By firmly focusing on&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and postdocs, who have already firmly committed their professional lives to STEM&lt;br/&gt;fields, this project's overarching goal is to give them the skills to ensure professional success. The larger&lt;br/&gt;objective is to encourage the creation of sustainable institutional cultures and programs that will increase&lt;br/&gt;the diversity of the professoriate in STEM disciplines, not simply at Brown and Columbia but across the&lt;br/&gt;32 members of the Leadership Alliance consortium and at other institutions of higher learning. This&lt;br/&gt;project's broad impact will take five specific, measurable forms. First, it will provide research universities nationwide with a review and evaluation of existing professional development, career training, skills-building,and mentoring programs for graduate students and postdocs from underrepresented groups at&lt;br/&gt;institutions across the United States. Second, this project will design, pilot, and assess replicable&lt;br/&gt;workshops in areas essential to the professional success of future STEM faculty. Third, the project will&lt;br/&gt;create and test instructional resources that will be readily available to institutions of higher learning via project website. Fourth, the project will provide postdocs from underrepresented groups authentic&lt;br/&gt;teaching experience to be better positioned for a future career as a professor. Fifth, this project will alter institutional cultures at leading research institutions by placing a greater emphasis on mentoring,&lt;br/&gt;professional development, skills-building, and career training to prepare students and postdocs to progress&lt;br/&gt;successfully along the academic pathway. All best practices in professional development and evaluations&lt;br/&gt;of the practices' effectiveness will be disseminated through the Leadership Alliance consortium, the&lt;br/&gt;project website, and public presentations and other outreach efforts. Through these activities this novel&lt;br/&gt;and potent Inter-Ivy AGEP will contribute to the societal goal of increased representation of&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented scholars as research leaders of the 21st century professoriate.</AbstractNarration>
