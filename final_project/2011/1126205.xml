    <AbstractNarration>This MRI award funds the acquisition of a LSM710 laser scanning confocal microscope to&lt;br/&gt;support research and training in plant signaling at the University of North Texas by providing&lt;br/&gt;imaging capabilities that are required for molecular and biochemical studies at the cellular and&lt;br/&gt;sub-cellular levels. In addition, the confocal microscope will enhance research and training in&lt;br/&gt;developmental physiology, eco-toxicology, neurobiology and microbiology. The LSM710 will&lt;br/&gt;come equipped with a 34-channel spectral detector that will facilitate studying the in situ&lt;br/&gt;expression pattern of genes, intracellular protein localization and protein-protein interactions,&lt;br/&gt;changes in Ca2+, reactive oxygen species and sugar fluxes, and macromolecular dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The LSM710 will benefit undergraduate and graduate students and post-docs&lt;br/&gt;by providing them training in the application of imaging technology for research and&lt;br/&gt;development. The confocal microscope will also provide opportunities to encourage and&lt;br/&gt;broaden the participation and training in the Life Sciences of underrepresented minorities, high&lt;br/&gt;school-aged students and future secondary teachers through the McNair program, the Teach&lt;br/&gt;North Texas program, the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, the Honors College, the&lt;br/&gt;NSF S-STEM supported (#0807128) Fostering Outstanding Cohorts in Undergraduate Science&lt;br/&gt;(FOCUS) Scholarships program, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;Science Education program at the University of North Texas. The LSM710 will support&lt;br/&gt;research by these students. The instrument will positively impact the environment and society&lt;br/&gt;by supporting research on the discovery, function and application of signaling mechanisms in&lt;br/&gt;plants, which will augment sustainable agriculture, industry and renewable natural resources.</AbstractNarration>
