    <AbstractNarration>The PI proposes to study several questions involving arithmetic aspects of&lt;br/&gt;maps between algebraic varieties. These questions include new far-reaching&lt;br/&gt;generalizations of major results about abelian varieties, including the&lt;br/&gt;Mordell--Lang conjecture (Faltings' theorem) and Merel's uniform boundedness&lt;br/&gt;theorem for rational torsion on elliptic curves over a number field. In the&lt;br/&gt;generalizations, the group structure in an abelian variety is replaced by&lt;br/&gt;objects which exist in any variety. The PI's study of maps between varieties&lt;br/&gt;will yield results about dynamical systems, Diophantine equations,&lt;br/&gt;automorphism groups of curves, and value distribution of meromorphic functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polynomials whose coefficients are rational numbers are a fundamental&lt;br/&gt;tool in many aspect of modern life, ranging from&lt;br/&gt;information security to weather prediction. These basic objects have been&lt;br/&gt;intensively studied for over two thousand years, but recent years have seen&lt;br/&gt;the discovery of previously unexpected phenomena. The proposed research will&lt;br/&gt;examine these fundamental objects from several perspectives. This will likely&lt;br/&gt;yield immediate consequences in computer science, in addition to long-term&lt;br/&gt;consequences across many disciplines. Finally, much of the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;will be carried out jointly with graduate and undergraduate students, so that&lt;br/&gt;it will make an educational contribution in addition to its scientific impact.</AbstractNarration>
