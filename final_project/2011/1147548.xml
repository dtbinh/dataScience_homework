    <AbstractNarration>A revolutionary new device concept that could enable the transformation of vacuum&lt;br/&gt;microelectronics from single charge carrier to bipolar devices (i.e., positive and negative charge) is&lt;br/&gt;proposed. This transformation is achieved by creating and modulating both ions and electrons&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously in a single vacuum microelectronic device (VMD) and has recently been&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated by RTI International and Duke University. This achievement represents the first&lt;br/&gt;demonstration of bipolar operation in a VMD, and the researchers believe the EArly-concept&lt;br/&gt;Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) Program provides an ideal mechanism for exploratory&lt;br/&gt;study of this new device concept, gaining a basic understanding of the new device operation and&lt;br/&gt;its ultimate potential in comparison to other electron devices. These bipolar vacuum&lt;br/&gt;microelectronic devices (BVMDs) have only recently been demonstrated for the first time, and&lt;br/&gt;thus they are at such an early stage of development that they do not fit within either existing or&lt;br/&gt;pending research programs. However, BMVDs represent a potentially transformative paradigm for&lt;br/&gt;electron devices. If this proposed EAGER program is successful, it could lead to entirely new&lt;br/&gt;fields of applications for VMDs in similar ways that CMOS technology transformed solid-state&lt;br/&gt;electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BVMD operation provides the equivalent of a field configurable bipolar junction transistor with&lt;br/&gt;all the advantages of VMDs with respect to operating temperature, radiation hardness, and high&lt;br/&gt;power/frequency capabilities. This proposal will focus first on developing a figure of merit that&lt;br/&gt;relates BVMDs to VMD and solid-state devices, followed by a detailed investigation of device&lt;br/&gt;operation across different pressure, temperature, and operational modes. The device model will&lt;br/&gt;be developed based on the COMSOL simulation platform, enabling detailed analysis of both&lt;br/&gt;electron and ion flux in the device as functions of various operating conditions (e.g., pressure,&lt;br/&gt;power, frequency). The simulations will be used to determine operational figures of merit and to&lt;br/&gt;aid in the design, development, and testing of next-generation BVMD devices. The successful&lt;br/&gt;research will enable both a better understanding of the device physics behind BVMDs and the&lt;br/&gt;ability to assess their ultimate potential.</AbstractNarration>
