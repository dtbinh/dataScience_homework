    <AbstractNarration>More than seven years after traditional processor designs hit the edge of their power envelope, the path of extreme scale Computational Science to a 100 petaflop (Pflop/s) system, which researchers had hoped to be using by the middle of the coming decade, has never looked steeper. On current high performance computing (HPC) systems, the 'application-architecture performance gap,' i.e. the gap between theoretical peak performance and the performance realized by full applications is already substantial. But with clock frequencies now capped below 4 GHz and trending downward, latencies in key areas (e.g. memory access, bus, system interconnect) expected to remain relatively stagnant, and software parallelism required to increase by at least three orders of magnitude to make effective use of the tens of thousands of processors and millions of cores that 100 Pflop/s systems are projected to contain, it is now reasonable to worry that a widening application-architecture performance gap will make such systems unproductive to use and therefore irrational to build. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to provide the kind of coordinated math and computer science research effort needed to solve the interrelated cluster of software problems that threaten to cripple application performance on future large-scale systems. Under the PULSAR project, the PIs use a variety of both classic and novel dense linear algebra algorithms to explore the potential of well known, but now little used systolic array design principles to exploit all the power that future multi-core and heterogeneous systems, built to extreme scales. If a software platform that virtualizes classic systolic array architecture, allowing for suitable flexibility in the granularity of its application can be created, then libraries and applications that use this data-driven execution model to achieve outstanding performance and scalability on future massively parallel and data-starved HPC systems can be produced.</AbstractNarration>
