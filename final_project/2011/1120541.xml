    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;The public genome data base identifies about 44 potential aminotransferase-like enzymes that are present in the genome of the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Aminotransferases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the transfer of an amino group from a donor that is usually an amino acid to an acceptor that is usually a 2-keto acid. These enzymes are involved in numerous anabolic and catabolic pathways including; amino acid metabolism, vitamin metabolism, and secondary metabolism, among others. Determination of the functional and biochemical proprties of these enzymes becomes important to understanding basic plant biology including plant growth and development. Because aminotransferases are ubiquitous also in other organisms, this study will provide insights into the role of these enzymes in other organisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt; This project will provide research mentoring and training opportunities for undergraduate students enrolled in the biology related programs at the Rochester Institute of Technology. This training is particular critical to mold future scientists, policymakers and informed citizens. The students are frequently from demographic groups that are under-represented in the STEM disciplines, most notably African American, Latino and Native American students.</AbstractNarration>
