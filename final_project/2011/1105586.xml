    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1105586&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Daniel M. Burns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the themes emphasized in these research projects are&lt;br/&gt;modern aspects of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory from the early days&lt;br/&gt;of quantum mechanics in the 1920s, value distribution theory and&lt;br/&gt;Ahlfors currents, and Grauert tubes. In physics the&lt;br/&gt;Bohr-Sommerfeld theory was created as a method for quantizing an&lt;br/&gt;integrable classical mechanical system. The principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator interprets the Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions for&lt;br/&gt;quantization as a geometric property, name a triviality condition&lt;br/&gt;on the holonomy of a certain flat bundle. Ongoing work seeks to&lt;br/&gt;understand the connections between singularities of Hamiltonians&lt;br/&gt;and singularities of underlying complex spaces, and the geometry&lt;br/&gt;of the Bohr-Sommerfeld construction seems to be a central focus&lt;br/&gt;of the story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Value distribution theory is a framework for attempting to count&lt;br/&gt;solutions to an equation in complex variables. The Fundamental&lt;br/&gt;Theorem of Algebra tells us that a polynomial equation of degree&lt;br/&gt;n in one variable has exactly n solutions over the complex&lt;br/&gt;numbers, if you count repeated roots with care. More complicated&lt;br/&gt;equations in a single complex variable can have infinitely many&lt;br/&gt;solutions, but these are spread around the complex plane and the&lt;br/&gt;number of solutions contained in a ball of radius R about the&lt;br/&gt;origin can only grow at a limited rate as R becomes large -- a&lt;br/&gt;situation greatly clarified by ideas introduced by the Finnish&lt;br/&gt;mathematician Rolf Nevanlinna in the 1920s, at about the same&lt;br/&gt;time that the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory was developed in physics.&lt;br/&gt;One of the projects supported by this award is a project that&lt;br/&gt;applies modern geometric tools to study the distribution of&lt;br/&gt;solutions to equations in several variables.</AbstractNarration>
