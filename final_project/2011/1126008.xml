    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award provides funding for the acquisition of an acoustical measurement system. The acquisition of the measurement system enables a new program for structural health monitoring for environmental changes on Maryland's Eastern Shore. It facilitates research of structural health monitoring using guided acoustic waves that can propagate a long distance in solid materials such as bars, plates and pipes. Specific research objectives include: (1) investigation of a time reversal Lamb wave communication system using steel pipes or bars as communication channels; (2) research of new methods for assessing material stress behaviors based on the Hopkinson' bar testing using strain sensors; and (3) development of novel approaches to extracting baseline free and baseline dependent defect features using integrated signal processing and machine learning techniques. The projects that will be supported by this equipment will enable understanding of the characteristics of the local civil structures and new design of SHM systems specific to the Eastern Shore's coastal environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the acquisition of this equipment will allow the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) to facilitate a new program to address the significant aging infrastructure problem facing the Eastern Shore area, but more widely the nation. It will enhance the quality of student research and instruction and provide faculty with the necessary tools to pursue aspects of their research which are presently not available to them. Each year, two undergraduate students will be intensely trained to operate this instrument. In addition, laboratory projects utilizing this equipment will be incorporated into several upper level undergraduate courses and senior design capstone projects affecting a minimum of thirty students per year. This instrument will also enhance collaboration with Salisbury University and the Northrop Grumman Technical Service facility, also located on Maryland's Eastern Shore.</AbstractNarration>
