    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this workshop is to bring together international experts in engineering, mathematics, and physics to have an open discussion on the possibility of multiscale modeling for engineering applications, and the potential and shortcomings of existing mathematical and physical approaches for solving such problems. A set of talented graduate students will be invited to these deliberations by open competition. The workshop will be held over three days in the latter half of September, 2011. Fifteen international experts will be invited to give lectures and participate in a panel discussion. A student poster session will be held for which fifteen students will be selected. In addition, ten other technical participants will be invited in the audience. Lecturers and student participants will be provided partial financial assistance. A Workshop reception and a banquet are planned as social events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The societal benefit of the proposed workshop lies in the fact that it is driven by core engineering-application-needs, but intends to involve pre-eminent mathematicians and physicists in a dialog with engineers to foster a three-way cross fertilization of ideas and practical methodology to address perhaps the most important problem of modern science and technology. The workshop is expected to produce a basis for understanding and evaluating multiscale modeling methodology that can serve as a common inter-disciplinary standard for the future and lead to strong collaborations between engineers, mathematicians, and physicists. Education of students in a non-standard but meaningful and prestigious format will take place.</AbstractNarration>
