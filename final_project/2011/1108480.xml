    <AbstractNarration>This Track 1 project is a proof-of-concept initiative to assess the effectiveness of a Native American geosciences education system modeled on a successful Native American Business Administration (NABA) curriculum that has built native student participation and success at Idaho State University. This system focuses on native-focused mentorship, tutoring and tribal community coordination and facilitation. Coordinated through the Indigenous Nations Institute (INI), this geosciences education and outreach project is developing effective educational engagement between Idaho State University and Tribal Colleges and their geosciences programs, focusing on collaborations with geoscience professionals at Stone Child College and Great Basin College, as well as with regional Tribal communities including the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes and Northwestern Band of Shoshone Nation. In these engagements, the project is recruiting three highly qualified and motivated students for geosciences training and education at Idaho State University. Students are receiving ongoing dialog and mentorship from INI native professionals and geoscience advisors, as well as robust tutoring in key technical course work. With support from INI, the students act as ambassadors to their Tribal communities and colleges to promote increased awareness and opportunities in geoscience education. Principal goals of this project are to implement and assess the effectiveness of the NABA Model for geoscience education, and to increase awareness of about the geosciences in Indian Country. Expected outcomes of this project include validation of the NABA student success model for geoscience education, creating a framework for a new Native American geoscience education center of excellence, developing collaborative education relationships with Tribal Colleges, and creating increased awareness of the geosciences among Native American students and communities, as well as career opportunities that are available in the geosciences.</AbstractNarration>
