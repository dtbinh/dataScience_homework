    <AbstractNarration>The University of Florida (UF) has developed the intellectual property for a novel visible light activated transparent antimicrobial coating. NanoHygienix LLC, a UF spin-off company headed by a UF business school graduate, is interested in commercializing this technology for preventing surface-mediated infections in hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, etc. The proposed research program will leverage the expertise in materials science, environmental engineering, chemistry, entrepreneurship, finance, marketing and business management. The PI has expertise in engineering and scale-up of particulate systems and their translation to various industry sectors including chemical, mineral, microelectronics, nano and biotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence of infections in hospitals and other healthcare settings. The PI is committed to recruit students from underrepresented groups through well established college and university programs such as SEAGEP and LSAMP. This project will promote innovation ecosystem infrastructure development across campus by bringing together engineering and business students and faculty. Project outcomes will include invention disclosures/patents, peer reviewed journal publications, dissertations, and presentations at professional society meetings. Ultimate benefits of the proposed activity will be best practices for commercializing the university innovations resulting in spin-of companies that will provide jobs and contribute to the economic well-being of the nation.</AbstractNarration>
