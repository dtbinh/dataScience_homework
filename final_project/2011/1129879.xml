    <AbstractNarration>SES - 1129879&lt;br/&gt;Kristen Marcussen (PI)&lt;br/&gt;Mary Gallagher (Co-PI)&lt;br/&gt;Kent State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral Dissertation Research: Sources of Psychological Distress among Adults&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Research in social psychology suggests that when individuals perceive a double standard between how others evaluate them and how they view themselves, that difference can contribute to psychological distress. However, we do not yet understand exactly the conditions under which such perceived discrepancies can create psychological distress. This project compares the degree to which specific social identities, especially those considered obligatory versus identities people can choose (voluntary), may affect people's self-concept and psychological distress in different ways. To that end, this research project involves a two-pronged methodology. The first part uses existing telephone survey data to examine the relationships between identity discrepancies, self-concept, and psychological distress in the context of one obligatory and one voluntary role. The second part of the project involves the collection of additional survey data to investigate the extent to which people's commitment to and the centrality of specific obligatory and voluntary identities affect the outcomes of interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this study may contribute to our understanding of how people's multiple identities and roles can either help mitigate or exacerbate psychological distress. In turn, findings may also inform clinical research and practice aimed at preventing and treating more severe forms of mental illness and the behavioral risks associated with mental illness. This research project will also provide practical survey research training and experience for a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students who will be conducting the telephone interviews at the Kent State Survey Research Center.</AbstractNarration>
