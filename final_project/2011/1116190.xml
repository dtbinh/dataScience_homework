    <AbstractNarration>In this project, protocols, mechanisms, and a Java implementation of &lt;br/&gt;nested distributed transactional memory (TM) are developed. Distributed TM promises &lt;br/&gt;to alleviate the programmability, scalability, and performance challenges of lock-based &lt;br/&gt;distributed concurrency control. Emerging distributed TM implementations export &lt;br/&gt;a simple programming interface that precludes locks and are yielding performance &lt;br/&gt;comparable to, or better than lock-based distributed concurrency control. Nesting is &lt;br/&gt;essential to distributed TM for composability, functionality, fault-management, and &lt;br/&gt;performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing protocols and mechanisms to support closed and open &lt;br/&gt;nesting in distributed TM. Closed nesting allows a nested transaction to be aborted &lt;br/&gt;without aborting the parent transaction, but not vice versa. Open nesting allows a &lt;br/&gt;parent transaction to be aborted without aborting the nested transaction, and vice &lt;br/&gt;versa, permitting greater concurrency. To support these nesting models, the project &lt;br/&gt;is developing distributed transactional conflict resolution protocols, distributed &lt;br/&gt;cache coherence protocols, and mechanisms for transparently executing &lt;br/&gt;compensating transactions to undo the effects of committed transactions. The &lt;br/&gt;project is implementing these techniques in the open-source, HyFlow distributed &lt;br/&gt;TM Java package (hyflow.org). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is also transitioning this technology (techniques and HyFlow &lt;br/&gt;implementation) to US Navy's Aegis Combat System, which uses distributed &lt;br/&gt;concurrency control. Additionally, the project's results are being incorporated into &lt;br/&gt;advanced graduate courses at Virginia Tech that includes students at Blacksburg, &lt;br/&gt;VA, scientists and engineers at US Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division &lt;br/&gt;(NSWCDD), VA (through Virginia Tech's graduate outreach program at NSWCDD), &lt;br/&gt;and students in the Middle East and North Africa through Virginia Tech's VT-MENA &lt;br/&gt;program at Egypt.</AbstractNarration>
