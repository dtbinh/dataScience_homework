    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;1128548&lt;br/&gt;Iowa State University&lt;br/&gt;Shanks&lt;br/&gt;Research and development at the NSF Engineering Research Center for Biorenewable Chemicals (CBiRC) has identified a method for the selective dehydration of glucose and starch to produce furan derivatives such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). HMF is a potentially valuable platform chemical that cannot be made cost effectively. This new process provides a cost-effective way of making HMF, opening the way to other valuable chemical intermediates that could replace key petroleum-based building blocks used in production of plastics, fine chemicals, diesel fuel and fuel additives. This new glucan-based method is more commercially viable than those previously developed because it uses glucose or starch to yield a high concentration of HMF. CBiRC is collaborating in this effort with a small business partner, GlucanBio, which has a licensing agreement with the University of Wisconsin, and the Grow Iowa Values Fund, which has provided some initial start-up funding. This effort will modify the initial research at the University of Wisconsin to provide a different precursor chemical feedstock. Combining these two has the potential to create chemicals that have great commercial value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this project is to explore the technical issues surrounding the processing conditions for HMF production. This will permit a techno-commercial feasibility study of scale-up production of HMF from glucose and starch. Key deliverables will be a full commercialization analysis of HMF from biomass. This will be used to support the development of a more complete business plan and commercialization proposal for HMF production. Specific objectives are: (i) Comparison of glucose and starch versus fructose catalysis with solvent extraction per Dumesic methods, (ii) Kinetics understood and optimized for the conversion of glucose to HMF in a batch reactor system, (iii) Kinetics understood and optimized for the conversion of glucose to HMF in a flow reactor system, (iv) Demonstration of a solid acid catalyst for the conversion of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides to HMF, (v) Evaluation of techno-commercial potential by estimating costs of production in optimized system, and (vi) Build the business case for a $10m investment in a pilot plant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work trains graduate and undergraduate students in targeted research affiliated with a startup entity. The effort will identify a path to a cost-effective production of HMF, which has massive potential to create a bio-based resource for resins, fuels, fuel additives, polymers, alkanes and solvents. Thus the project is primarily focused on addressing HMF production from glucose, starch and cellulose as the cheapest bio-based source. Based on a techno-commercial analysis of HMF production from fructose, HMF can be produced from glucose or starch at a minimum selling price of $3-4 per gallon. Further cost improvements are likely through other process improvements. Building upon this least-cost source of biomass using a known catalytic process means that a low-cost-of-production HMF can then be used to directly create an interesting array of molecules from the parent species. Thus it becomes possible to conceive of a commercially viable path to an array of valuable bio-based products.</AbstractNarration>
