    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1159052&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Michael Bevan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides travel support to partially cover costs associated with engineering graduate students and one overseas speaker to attend the 86th ACS Colloid and Surface Science Symposium, June 10-13, 2012. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will have presentations on topics, session organizers, keynote and plenary speakers. The travel grant will be used for partial support of travel costs of one international speaker and to support engineering graduate students, as well as other invited speakers who are engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The symposium will provide a forum for communicating fundamentally new insights into colloidal and surface science with relevance to existing complex fluids and advanced materials applications as well as emerging nano- and bio- technologies. Due to the broad scope, this meeting will attract diverse disciplines (e.g. Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Materials Science, Physics, etc.) and nearly all major US academic institutions and many leading international institutions. The diversity of the attendees and the talks is further represented by contributions from theoretical, computational, and experimental groups and the participation of scientists and engineers from all sectors including industry, government, and academia.</AbstractNarration>
