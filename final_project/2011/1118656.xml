    <AbstractNarration>The Clemson Calculus Challenge (CCC) is a one-day calculus competition for high school students that has been organized and hosted by the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Clemson University annually since the spring of 2003. The CCC provides a venue for mathematically talented high school students to compete and receive recognition in an individual exam and a team competition. Students are tested on their knowledge of the topics found in the College Board Advanced Placement Calculus AB syllabus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CCC seeks to attract a diverse audience of at least 250 high school students from the southeastern United States to compete each year. Through competition, the CCC strives to (1) motivate high school students to obtain a more profound understanding of calculus; (2) raise expectations for knowledge, skill levels and performance for high school calculus programs; (3) recognize those students who perform well during the competition; (4) expose high school students to research in the sciences that requires calculus competency; and (5) provide a forum for high school teachers to interact with each other. Funding is primarily used to support participant travel so that more high schools can compete, and, in particular, so that more schools from economically depressed school districts or who serve a large percentage of financially disadvantaged or first generation students may attend.</AbstractNarration>
