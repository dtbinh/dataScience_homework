    <AbstractNarration>This award will fund a symposium that will provide information and opportunities for collaboration for the purpose of translating discoveries in developmental cognitive neuroscience into classroom practices. This conference will bring together cognitive neuroscientists, psychologists, experts in human development, educational researchers, teachers, and parents to increase understanding of the issues important for creating effective learning methods for both the typical development of cognitive skills and for those with learning disabilities. The conference agenda will address the following issues: 1) the early cognitive developmental factors that prepare the brain for learning; 2) the most recent advances in developmental cognitive neuroscience research to inform development of novel teaching methods and remediation; 3) discoveries related to both typical and atypical development within the topical areas of reading and language, mathematical ability, and executive function and attention; 4) the relationships between learning each of these "modular" skills and an underlying neural system for learning and skill acquisition that crosses all domains; 5) the unique social, emotional, and economic problems that are associated with poor outcomes in school, and 6) strategies for translating new findings from the laboratory into improved learning methods in the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New discoveries in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience hold great promise for improving current teaching methods. Yet there remains a significant gap between the scientific discoveries that could improve our education system and the application of this knowledge. This meeting will highlight cutting-edge developments in cognitive neuroscience that could improve current teaching methods and will include a careful review of the current obstacles to applying these methods in the classroom as well as the related emotional, sociological and environmental factors. This meeting is also expected to increase collaborations and communications among basic researchers and educators and will include detailed and extensive dissemination for both the scientific community and lay public.</AbstractNarration>
