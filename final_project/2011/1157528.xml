    <AbstractNarration>PI: Haiping Hong &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CBET - 1157528&lt;br/&gt;Institution: South Dakota School of Mines and Technology&lt;br/&gt;Title: Carbon Nano-materials and Application Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carbon nanomaterials, e.g., carbon nanotubes, nanoparticles, and graphene, continue to attract significant interest because of their unique blend of thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties. This workshop on Carbon Nanomaterials and their applications will be held in South Dakota with the goal of developing a "roadmap" for future carbon nanomaterials research. Leaders in this field will be invited to attend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will focus on new directions and frontiers in carbon nanotubes, their alignment and applications. In the last decade, while significant research in these areas have been done, it is felt that a focused interchange of ideas would lead to the next roadmap of technical challenges and practical outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will try to foster the development of the next generation of carbon nanomaterials in a range of applications from electronic cooling, seals, heat exchangers, and energy harvesting. A workshop report that summarizes the discussions and recommendations of the group will be submitted for publication in a widely read international journal.</AbstractNarration>
