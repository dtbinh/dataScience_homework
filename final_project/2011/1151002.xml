    <AbstractNarration>In this EAGER project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Laura L. Kiessling of the University of Wisconsin will study how to exploit the defined orientation of oligomeric proteins by using them as stamps to pattern polymerizable lipid bilayer surfaces. The approach is to assemble glycolipids within fluid lipid bilayers through binding with a multimeric protein and then to trap the positions of the glycolipids via photopolymerization. After disruption of the protein interaction the patterned surface will be revealed and then the layer will be assayed to determine the protein-binding selectivity and imaged using AFM to determine the dimensions of the glycolipid domains. The broader impacts involve training undergraduate and graduate students, mentoring undergraduate students from minority groups underrepresented in the chemical sciences, and disseminating research results broadly through presentations at conferences and publications in journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research could lead to new ways to imprint ultrasmall patterns on a surface using large molecules found in biological systems. The work could impact many areas of science and technology including nanofabrication, chemical biology and many fields of medicine, and it could lead to new applications in nanotechnology, environmental sensing, pharmaceutical science and biotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
