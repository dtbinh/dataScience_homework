    <AbstractNarration>The Robert Noyce Urban Mathematics Educator Program (UMEP) Phase II is designed to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the UMEP that began as a Phase I Noyce Teachers Scholarship program for career changers seeking teaching positions in secondary mathematics. Partnering school districts, the Atlanta Public Schools and the DeKalb County School System are actively engaged in all aspects of the program from selection of UMEP Scholars to the degree program to the placement of UMEP Scholars in teaching positions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From 2005 through 2010, thirty-six UMEP Noyce Scholars completed the Master's Degree with initial certification and began teaching in high need schools. Thirty-three UMEP Noyce Scholars have remained in teaching and are becoming exemplars as professional educators. The UMEP operates as an active online Professional Learning Community composed of the UMEP Scholars, the UMEP Leadership team, and UMEP Noyce Scholars who have evolved as teacher leaders. In Phase II, the project extends and expands on-going research on the online learning community as well as continues research and evaluation on the effectiveness of the degree program, selection process, preparation, placement and retention of the UMEP Scholars. The UMEP is becoming prominent for the retention of exemplary teachers in high-need schools. Plans for dissemination of the findings from the research and evaluation are to contribute to the knowledge of preparation, placement, and retention of effective secondary mathematics in high-need schools.</AbstractNarration>
