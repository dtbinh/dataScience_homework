    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Using the bacterium E. coli as a model system, this study addresses the fundamental scientific problem of how cells divide. In a key step, the essential protein FtsZ forms a cytoskeletal ring structure at midcell that establishes the site of division and provides a structural framework for the localization of a multi-protein "molecular machine" that promotes division in bacteria. FtsZ is an ancient protein that is found in most bacteria, some archaea, all chloroplasts, and in primitive mitochondria. A number of proteins interact directly with FtsZ and regulate FtsZ polymer assembly/disassembly at midcell ensuring the spatial and temporal integrity of bacterial cell division. The molecular nature of the diverse protein-protein interactions that regulate the assembly of FtsZ during early stages of division are not yet well understood. Therefore, the identification of the full complement of FtsZ regulatory proteins and their interactions with FtsZ will greatly aid in developing a comprehensive understanding of FtsZ structure and assembly dynamics in the cell. The present project focuses on two newly identified FtsZ-associated proteins (Zap) in E. coli and their molecular interactions with FtsZ. The Zap proteins are conserved in a number of related bacterial species. An analysis of FtsZ-Zap interactions to atomic or near atomic precision in the genetically tractable E. coli will enhance the understanding of the complex interplay between FtsZ and its associated proteins in other bacterial species. More broadly, this research is also expected to further our understanding of fundamental aspects of bacterial cell biology.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;As the only research laboratory at City College of New York with an emphasis in prokaryotic biology, a field with important implications in the understanding of fundamental cellular processes required by all organisms, this project will form a basis for innovative curriculum development in the classroom, as well as research training for graduate and undergraduate students. Mentoring of City College students, many of whom are minority and/or female, through successful research projects contributes to nationwide efforts to encourage members of underrepresented groups to choose and succeed in research careers. To specifically generate excitement about microbial processes among younger students, members of the research laboratory will continue to participate in several community outreach initiatives in City College's upper Manhattan neighborhood. These efforts include involvement in a local middle school science club and the summer College Now program, a free CUNY initiative to support high school students' early interest in science, improve their science preparation for college, and inspire them to make college science study an attainable goal.</AbstractNarration>
