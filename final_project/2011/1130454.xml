    <AbstractNarration>This Doctoral Dissertation Enhancement Project (DDEP) award will support the research of Ph.D. student Ms. Augusta M. Hofstead-Duffy on electrocatalysis relevant to the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). The latter is a promising clean energy alternative to fossil fuels and has advantages for large-scale commercial implementation. The focus of the study is to gain further mechanistic insights on the methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions through in situ time-resolved infrared spectroscopy on shape controlled Pt nanoparticles. The study will be performed under the guidance of Dr. Shi-Gang Sun of Xiamen University (China) as a supplement to the US-China collaborative project Nanoscale Single-Crystal Ensemble Electrocatalysis for Fuel Cell Applications. There are a variety of powerful spectroscopic techniques available in the host laboratory combining electrochemistry and vibrational spectroscopy that expose valuable chemical information during the course of the electrocatalytic reaction. The mechanistic information expected to be obtained during this study will provide a better understanding of activities and mechanisms as it relates to electrocatalyst shape and size during the aforementioned reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide a systematic and detailed analysis of the molecular-scale processes occurring on the fuel cell anodes. The project will allow the PhD student gain meaningful international experience. Successful development of improved DMFCs could provide considerable economic and environmental benefits.</AbstractNarration>
