    <AbstractNarration>In this project, co-funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program and the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Richard G. Weiss of Georgetown University will investigate the structure and dynamics of self-assembly of molecules derived from naturally hydroxyalkanoic acids into fibrillar objects and gels and other molecules yielding new ionic liquids, ionic liquid crystals, and polymers. Some of the materials will be chiral and/or thermally or chemically reversible based on the uptake and loss of neutral triatomic molecules, such as carbon dioxide. By relating the structural and temporal evolution of the aggregation and nucleation processes, a correlation between nanoscale and macroscale objects will be made. The influence of solvent, especially as it pertains to the aggregation and growth of the objects, will be investigated as well. The overall objective is to create a picture of how and why molecules aggregate into the various one-dimensional objects so that the rules for such processes can be applied to a wide variety of systems. The broader impacts involve training graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs to solve interdisciplinary problems. In addition, the research will expose the young scientists to researchers from other institutions within the United States and in developing countries. While the research will primarily impact fundamental chemical science the outcomes will also be important for applications in which gels are important, such as oil recovery, art conservation and food science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gels are composed of extended aggregates of molecule, and are found in nature as well as industrial products. This research project will enhance our understanding of how molecules assemble into gel-forming structures and will form the basis for understanding more complex natural and engineered systems, such as how amyloid fibers form in the brain, how blood clots form and how better protective coatings can be engineered.</AbstractNarration>
