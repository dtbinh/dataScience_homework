    <AbstractNarration>This award in the Division of Chemistry supports research by Professor Mahdi Abu-Omar at Purdue University to study electron transfer, proton-coupled electron transfer, and hydrogen atom transfer reactions. In addition, the catalysis of C-H amination, nitrene transfer and hydrogen atom transfer reactions by nonheme iron(IV) imido complexes will be explored. A molecular catalyst that mimics the enzyme chlorite dismutase and is selective for chlorite dismutation to dioxygen and innocuous chloride will also be investigated. The manganese porphyrin system and nonheme catalysts that perform these reactions will be completely characterized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will study how electrons and atoms transfer between molecules and will investigate molecular mimics of the enzyme chlorite dismutase. These investigations involve chemical synthesis, catalysis, kinetics, and mechanisms, which will prepare postdoctoral and graduate students for academic, industrial, and government careers. Collaborations with leading scientists in Japan (Professor Fukuzumi, Osaka University) and Korea (Professor Nam, Ewha Womans University) will further broaden the students' scientific perspectives.</AbstractNarration>
