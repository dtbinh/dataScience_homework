    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is the development of a method that enables the isolation of a population of mutant embryos that does not rely on identification by visible defect. Development is a universal process where a fertilized egg matures into a fully formed organism. In the quest to understand organismal development, it has been the focus of intensive scientific investigation for more than a century. Despite its long history of rigorous study the molecular mechanisms that drive the developmental program are still poorly understood. The study of gene mutation has thus far been one of the best tools to reveal molecular details of the developmental program. However, this approach is limited by the fact that mutant organisms are identified by visible identification of defects caused by the mutation, which are generally apparent well after the underlying molecular causes take place. Although modern technologies exist to examine the molecular changes that occur prior to visible defects, they require isolation of a large population of purely mutant organisms well before defects are apparent. Using Drosophila (fruit fly) genetic techniques, this laboratory has developed a method for generating males and females that produce only mutant sperm and eggs and therefore will create a population of purely mutant embryos that can be molecularly analyzed well before defects are visible. The focus of this project is to develop further this method so it can be broadly used to study the majority of genes in Drosophila and make it available as a general tool for all Drosophila researchers. Since many of the processes that govern organismal development are similar across species information generated using this technique in Drosophila are broadly applicable to the molecular mechanisms that drive development in other organisms, such as humans. This study will also enhance science education and promote the development of future researchers, as graduate and undergraduate researchers will be actively engaged in this project.</AbstractNarration>
