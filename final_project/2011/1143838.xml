    <AbstractNarration>ISVD 2012 will be the continuation of a highly successful and innovative series of conferences within the geometric modeling and computer graphics disciplines. The eight previous events were held in Tokyo, Japan; Seoul, Korea; Banff, Canada; Kiev, Ukraine; Copenhagen, Denmark; Quebec City, Canada, and Quin Dao, China. While many conferences in the areas of computational geometry, computer graphics and engineering have touched some topics covered by the proposed event, it is only recently that the Voronoi diagram research has formed into a separate discipline and the unique forum on Voronoi Diagrams in Science and Engineering was created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the International Conferences on Voronoi Diagrams in Science and Engineering is to concentrate specifically on unique aspects of the research into the Voronoi diagrams and on practical applications of this research to manufacturing engineering, VLSI design, communication, geomatics, GIS (geographical information systems), urban planning, medicine, bioinformatics, high-performance computing, education and other applications. Another unique aspect is that this year will also feature a Voronoi Art Symposium that runs concurrently with the conference and showcases artistic drawings and interpretations of the Voronoi concept. This event, without a doubt, bridges the gap between Sciences and Arts.</AbstractNarration>
