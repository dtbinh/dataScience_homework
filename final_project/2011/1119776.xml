    <AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Marcus Langseth, a 235? Global seismic vessel with general oceanographic capabilities operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The request is for one item: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WesternGeco?s remaining SYNTRAK streamer system: $400,000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Langseth, while operated as a general-purpose research vessel, possesses a unique capability with multichannel seismic acquisition systems and sound source arrays. These systems permit scientists to develop images of the earth?s structure, now in three dimensions, thereby gaining a better understanding of processes that affect society. One example is tsunami-generating and otherwise damaging earthquakes. As a result the Langseth presents a singular opportunity for researchers from across the country and around the world to investigate a range of questions regarding the marine sciences. &lt;br/&gt;Another area of impact is the contribution to education of students pursuing marine graduate degrees in the ocean sciences and in the case of the Langseth, marine geophysics. Participants in these programs also include undergraduates. In all cases the student participates as an integral member of a research team to obtain firsthand experience in at-sea research. Public outreach is ongoing throughout the year. The Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory website provides the opportunity for the public and the community to learn about the Langseth?s capabilities and serves as a window into the world of science.</AbstractNarration>
