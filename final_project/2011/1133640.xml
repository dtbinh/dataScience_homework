    <AbstractNarration>1133640&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dickerson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fourth International Conference on Electrophoretic Deposition: Fundamentals and Applications (EPD-2011) will be held October 2-7, 2011 in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. This international meeting will involve participants from various sectors of the research community including academia, industry, and federal government agencies. EPD 2011 offers a rich atmosphere for the presentation and exchange of ideas centered on the advancement of electrophoretic deposition (EPD) and its associated science and technology. This grant will help support the travel of young, emerging scientists and established eminent researchers from the United States to EPD-2011, during which explorations and discussions of materials fabrication, advanced techniques, and innovations using electrophoretic deposition will be conducted. &lt;br/&gt;The increased participation of scientists from the United States in this rapidly developing area of science and engineering is crucial to the dissemination of information about the field and the subsequent, eventual training of an internationally competitive workforce in the US. EPD 2011 follows from the success of the previous conferences of the series held in 2002, 2005 and 2008. These tri-annual Electrophoretic Deposition (EPD) conferences are a leading venue for experts from academia and industry working on EPD and its application as a processing technique for fabrication of both traditional and new (nano-) materials. EPD-2011 will tackle topics at the forefront of the field such as nanostructured materials, biomaterials, and solid oxide fuel cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EPD-2011 will result in the following broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;I. The advancement of knowledge at the intersection of the fields of physics, electrokinetics,&lt;br/&gt;materials science, chemistry, and manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;II. Providing a forum for young scholars to interact with seasoned research professionals.&lt;br/&gt;III. Developing international research partnerships that address technical challenges of EPD.&lt;br/&gt;IV. Introduce and develop new partnerships among groups of junior faculty, early career scientists, and more established, eminent scholars, particularly those from underrepresented groups, in this rapidly emerging area of science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
