    <AbstractNarration>This proposal provides support for early-career scientists from USA to participate in the international field conference "Deformation Localization in Rocks: new advances," to take place in Cap de Creus, Spain, in June-July 2011. The meeting, sponsored by the Geological Society of America as a Penrose Field Conference, features new theoretical, analytical, geospatial, and visualization methods developed for study of shear zones, examined with the natural world context of the diverse exemplary structures that exist in the superb three-dimensional exposures of Cap de Creus. The study of shear zones is important because these features accommodate deep deformation in the earth's lithosphere caused by tectonic plate interactions. Without a thorough understanding of the dynamics of these specific features, we cannot begin to predict the dynamics of the earth's lithosphere during tectonic plate interactions, which are responsible for major earth phenomena like faulting and earthquakes. This conference represents a singular opportunity for early-career investigators from the United States to present their own research results within a small international gathering, to interact with international and U.S. scientists who are conducting innovative research on shear zones, and to participate in conversations about future research directions that are grounded in the observation of diverse shear zone structures in the natural setting at Cap de Creus. The objective of our proposal is to provide eight young investigators with: exposure to cutting edge intellectual approaches; practical skills and analytical tools; professional mentors; and an international peer network focused on shear zones research. The experience will enhance the researchers' ability to be competitive for scientific grants and to establish new research programs in USA.</AbstractNarration>
