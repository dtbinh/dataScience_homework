    <AbstractNarration>This project will support a workshop on the topics of sustainable fuels and clean vehicles that will be held in conjunction with a planning visit to Zhejiang University and Shanghai Jiaotong University in China. The project aims at establishing new international collaboration in both research and education on sustainable fuels and clean vehicles. We face a critical challenge of transforming our current dependence on fossil-fuel-based energy to sustainable energy sources. The workshop provides an opportunity to bring together researchers from academia, national laboratories, and industries to exchange research experience and develop a coordinated strategy to increase competencies in transportation sustainability. The specific focus of the near- and long-term collaborative research programs will be in sustainability analyses of advanced biofuel transportation systems, biomass and biowaste for liquid fuel conversion, bioscience and engineering of biomass production, enabling technology for the utilization of alternative and renewable fuels in transportation vehicles, and advanced hybrid and clean vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have an impact on realizing the maximum fuel economy, meeting the environmental constraints, and increasing the potential for utilizing bio-fuels in vehicles to ensure the timely achievement of energy security and emissions targets. The workshop and visit will lay the foundation for future collaborative research. The international engagement and collaboration on sustainable fuels and clean vehicles will advance sustainable energy solutions, which are adaptable to different locations with diverse climates and geopolitical structures. The planned collaboration will engage women and early career faculty members. The established international educational partnership will have a positive impact to the training of the next generation workforce in the U.S.</AbstractNarration>
