    <AbstractNarration>In order to strengthen graduate education in representation theory and help our graduate students gain international working experiences, the proposed project is to support the travel of U.S. graduate students to attend the second US-China summer program during during June 28-July 10 2011 at South China University of Technology. The summer program will feature 3 or more short courses given by leading experts on algebraic, analytic, combinatorial, and geometric aspects of representation theory. About 50 Chinese students from more than half dozen major mathematical departments and research centers in China will attend the joint US-China summer school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Representation theory has been a central theme in mathematics and physics for the last several decades. It is so broad that almost all major mathematical areas have connections to it. Many research groups world wide do work related to representation theory from various perspectives using different tools. Thus it is especially important that a graduate student training in this area has exposure to some of the breadth of the area.</AbstractNarration>
