    <AbstractNarration>1134882 Colorado School of Mines; Michael Kaufman &lt;br/&gt;1134873 University of North Texas; Peter Collins &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Advanced Non-Ferrous Structural Alloys will focus on the physical metallurgy of non-ferrous alloys (alloying and processing effects on microstructure, properties and performance) and on the industries that develop, manufacture, and use these alloys. Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and the University of North Texas (UNT) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with CSM as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center aims to establish the industrial support, operational mechanisms, and a prospective research portfolio for a viable research Center that will conduct critical basic and applied physical metallurgy research of direct relevance to the industries that develop, manufacture and use advanced non-ferrous structural alloys. The PIs are proposing the following topical areas: high performance alloys (nickel base super alloys and titanium base alloys), lightweight alloys including aluminum, magnesium (and their composites), and advanced alloys and processes. The PIs will insure that students have the opportunity to work on state-of-the-art projects and to be mentored by both experimental and modeling experts. The management of these focus areas is being modeled after the highly successful Advanced Steel Products and Processing Center at CSM, namely, by having companies designate what portion of their membership fees they wish to have distributed into the three specific focus areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center has the potential to improve sustainability and profitability of US manufacturing by developing advanced non-ferrous alloys that could reduce energy consumption and pollution in the manufacturing of these alloys. The research would also improve the competitiveness of US manufacturers. Given that the focus of the proposed center will be on the physical metallurgy of structural non-ferrous alloys, the associated programs of study at the two institutions will be reexamined and potentially modified in order to insure that the undergraduate and graduate curricula are consistent with this focus. In other words, both institutions will work to insure that the undergraduate and graduate students receive proper education and training in order for them to be well grounded in fundamental principles of physical metallurgy. As a center interacting with industry, the PIs intend to reach out to local communities to bring their attention to the issues facing this particular industry sector and how the institutions can assist these industries as they compete in these global markets. The center will also insure that diversity is one of the criteria in the selection of both undergraduate and graduate students who are considered for the industry relevant projects.</AbstractNarration>
