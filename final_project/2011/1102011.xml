    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate the critical parameters in controlling charge dissociation at donor-acceptor interfaces, charge transport in interpenetrating donor and acceptor networks, and charge collection at electrodes in organic solar cells. The approach is to use unique magneto-optical measurements: magnetic field effects of photocurrent and light-assisted dielectric response as effective tools to elucidate internal light-electricity conversion processes in organic bulk-heterojunction systems. The goal is to enhance the development of fundamental guidelines for material engineering and device design to develop highly efficient organic solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit includes the use of unique magneto-optical measurements for the investigation of internal photovoltaic processes towards the development of highly efficient organic solar cells. The unique magneto-optical measurements: magnetic field effects of photocurrent and light-assisted dielectric response can function as effective tools to ?visualize? the internal photovoltaic processes in the generation of photocurrent. The investigation of internal photovoltaic processes can elucidate the critical parameters to address critical issues involved in light-electricity conversion in controlling charge dissociation, transport, and collection processes in organic solar cells. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact includes the integration of research with education through curriculum development, class projects, minority and female student training, and outreach activities in the area of organic solar cells. On one hand, this project can impact the research and development of highly efficient organic solar cells. On the other hand, through the integration with education this project can enhance the preparation of high-quality working forces in renewable energy-engineering disciplines for economic development in our society.</AbstractNarration>
