    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor Arnold Rheingold from University of California San Diego will upgrade an X-ray diffractometer with a high-flux, high-energy microfocus source and a new detector. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) carbon dioxide-fixation chemistry, (b) designed protein synthesis, and (c) studies of post-synthetic metal-organic framework modification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The high-flux, high-energy source will generate a high flux of X-ray that will allow studies of very small crystals or poorly diffracting crystalline materials. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research not only at UC San Diego but many other neighboring universities and colleges.</AbstractNarration>
