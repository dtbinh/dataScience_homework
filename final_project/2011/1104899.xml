    <AbstractNarration>This RAPID project supports a series of three workshops with mathematicians, mathematics educators, and research methodologists to design an analysis, and conduct analysis, of a new national longitudinal study of high school Algebra learning. This project will provide a new plan for analysis of mathematics learning using a new longitudinal data base. The analysis plan is intended to stimulate future research studies in algebra learning. The investigator has invited about 20 mathematics education researchers, mathematicians, research methodologists, and graduate students to meet three times to create a research analysis plan for the new longitudinal survey data on high school Algebra learning and to inform the upcoming rounds of data collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complex longitudinal study is supported by both the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The NCES has not previously considered the essential elements of mathematics learning in their planned analysis. This project will create a new set of analysis plans as seen from the view of researchers and educators who study mathematics learning. The outcome of this project will enhance the use and policy value of the statistical analysis of this new large survey. The participants will also include state representatives because the study will contribute data about 10 states for the first time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new plan for analysis will provide needed frameworks for the understanding of high school algebra learning. Importantly, this project will provide an opportunity for insights about Algebra learning by involving well known mathematics educators as well as aspiring graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
