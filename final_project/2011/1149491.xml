    <AbstractNarration>Current theories of galaxy formation predict that the gas supply of galaxies is continuously replenished by the accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium and the cosmic web. For low-mass galaxies in low-density environments, most of this gas remains cool as it falls along filaments onto the galaxy disks. Dr. Pisano will observe faint neutral hydrogen emission from these systems using single-dish radio telescopes and next-generation radio interferometers. To date, such observations have revealed gas clouds around many galaxies, but the inferred accretion rates are too low to sustain star formation. By mapping the diffuse gas around galaxies, this project will determine the gas accretion rate onto local galaxies and, using the demographics of gas around galaxies plus detailed observations of individual systems, will associated the hydrogen with either a tidal origin or cold accretion for the first time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help address lagging student achievement in STEM subjects amongst middle school students, Dr. Pisano and collaborators will develop an open-ended, inquiry-based educational activity, "What are those THINGS?" This activity will engage West Virginia middle school students in real astronomical research using archival multi-wavelength data on the THINGS galaxy sample followed by the opportunity to use the Skynet remotely-operable telescopes to acquire their own original optical, infrared, and radio data for their adopted galaxy. Throughout this activity, trained undergraduate and graduate students will mentor the middle school students. As such, this activity will provide inspiration and training to students of all levels to become the next generation of astronomers and educators.</AbstractNarration>
