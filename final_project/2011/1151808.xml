    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Developing, managing, evaluating and disseminating NSF educational projects is sometimes difficult. Challenges include developing faculty communities, using more robust evaluation methods, and encouraging broader adoption. This project supports a series of half-day interactive web-based seminars directed to engineering and computer science faculty members to help them better understand how to address these issues in grant proposals by demonstrating project design, management, evaluation and dissemination. Participants learn about NSF programs, discuss educational theory and perform mock reviews. The developed materials are being archived and made available to the education community.</AbstractNarration>
