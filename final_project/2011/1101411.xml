    <AbstractNarration>GHz PHONONIC CRYSTAL DEVICES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal targets the development of a new class of GHz nanoscale phononic crystal (PC) devices that will be employed to understand and engineer the fundamental properties of low loss acoustic materials at the nanoscale, demonstrate acoustic functionalities such as tunneling, waveguiding and multiplexing and synthesize miniaturized radio frequency (RF) signal processors that are not attainable with state-of-the-art micro/nano mechanical (M/NEMS) resonators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The main merit of this proposal consists in devising a transformative class of acoustic devices simultaneously capable of high Q, direct matching to 50 Ã™ and unprecedented functionalities such as frequency multiplexing in a significantly reduced form factor than what is currently possible with RF components. Furthermore, the project will enable some transformative advancement at the fundamental physics level by developing experimental tools for the understanding of phonon-phonon interactions at frequencies close to and above the phonon relaxation time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The PI will be involved in organizing educational activities with local high schools in Philadelphia, with special attention to underrepresented minorities. The collaborative effort between the PI's laboratory and the West Philadelphia schools will allow high school students doing research in the PI's laboratory to learn more about cutting-edge science and technology. Undergraduate students will be involved in research activities via research positions and summer REU programs. The fundamental discoveries enabled by this project will be included in the current graduate course the PI is teaching. Finally, the PI plans to involve the general public by presenting his research findings at the Penn Nanoday.</AbstractNarration>
