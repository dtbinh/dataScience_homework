    <AbstractNarration>The State University of New York (SUNY) Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority&lt;br/&gt;Participation (SUNY LSAMP), under the leadership of SUNY-Stony Brook, will support&lt;br/&gt;12 additional post-baccalaureate students during the 2011-2013 Bridge to the Doctorate&lt;br/&gt;(BD) program at the SUNY-Binghamton. This program builds on previous program&lt;br/&gt;efforts that have not only significantly added to the graduate enrollment and masters&lt;br/&gt;and doctoral degrees to students from underreprested minority (UREP) populations but&lt;br/&gt;have also led to important changes in the culture and practice of STEM education in&lt;br/&gt;ways that not only help UREP students but all graduate STEM students.&lt;br/&gt;The project adds to current efforts by SUNY LSAMP to build research capacity in STEM&lt;br/&gt;education in the area of graduate education. The lessons learned from the study of the&lt;br/&gt;Bridge to the Doctorate Program will be put into the context of broader issues of&lt;br/&gt;systemic change and disseminated to a broad national audience.&lt;br/&gt;Using the lessons learned from this project, the alliance expects to continue to develop&lt;br/&gt;and refine strategies that will increase the recruitment and retention of graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and further diversify graduate education departments. The strategy has the&lt;br/&gt;potenital to increase the number of UREP STEM students who successfully complete&lt;br/&gt;doctoral degrees in STEM disciplines and make changes in STEM departmental culture&lt;br/&gt;and practice.</AbstractNarration>
