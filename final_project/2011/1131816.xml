    <AbstractNarration>The bioavailability of nutrients plays a crucial role in oceanic biological productivity, the carbon cycle, and climate change. The global ocean inventory of nitrogen (N) is determined by the balance of N-fixation (sources) and denitrification (sinks). In this three-year project, a researcher from the University of California, Santa Cruz, will focus on developing compound-specific N isotope (d15N) analysis of amino acids as a new tool for understanding N source and transformation of organic matter in paleo-reservoirs. The offsets in the isotopic ratios of individual amino acid groups may yield information about trophic transfer, heterotrophic microbial reworking, and autotrophic versus heterotrophic sources. By measuring and comparing the bulk and amino acid d15N in size-fractioned samples from plankton tows, sediments traps, and multi-cores in oxic and suboxic depositional environments, the researcher will: (1) Provide a proxy of the d15N of average exported photoautotrophic organic matter; and (2) Provide a new level of detail into sedimentary organic N degradation and preservation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve understanding of the fundamental underpinnings and behaviors of d15N amino acid patterns and how they behave in contrasting sedimentary environments, while also developing a potential paleoceanographic proxy. Funding will support a graduate student and undergraduate research at the institution. The researcher will also conduct community outreach in the form of a workshop/tutorial on the proxy development.</AbstractNarration>
