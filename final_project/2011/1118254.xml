    <AbstractNarration>Following the Horizon Well oil spill into the Gulf of Mexico that occurred in 2010, Dillard University proposes a RAPID project for students and faculty to participate in the sampling and biomarker analysis of air, water, and sediments from oil-impacted shoreline and from pristine shorelines under various meteorological conditions. Sampling will be conducted to assess the effects of weathering as well as seasonal changes in surface temperature. Archival samples will be collected and analyzed on bioarerosal culturing assays, by quantitative microscopy, by testing of the genotoxic effect of the particulate matter. Airborne particulate matter will be analyzed for its total carbon content and it total biological load (carbohydrate, protein, phospholipid, and DNA). The project will seek to assess the effect that weathering hydrocarbons and dispersants from the oil spill will have on increasing the numbers of particles which can penetrate the human respiratory system and the toxicity potential that those particles will carry over aerosols generated in their pristine counterparts.</AbstractNarration>
