    <AbstractNarration>This project is a transformative effort that will leverage the combined resources of the automotive engineering technology (AET), computer engineering technology (CET), and mechanical engineering technology (MET) programs at Indiana State University (ISU) toward enhancing teaching effectiveness and student employability. Project tasks include: 1) creating application-specific classroom hardware and lab modules; 2) enhancing hands-on learning in the three engineering technology programs; 3) improving teaching effectiveness and collaboration among faculty members; 4) enhancing curriculum to better respond to workforce requirement in industry; and 5) increasing diversity. Using a customized educational microcontroller board and an inclusive suite of co-developed teaching materials and lab projects, students will engage microcontroller-based, automobile-related measurement and control education using hands-on laboratories. CET students will gain practical experience in microcontroller applications solving real-world problems; AET students will learn basic automotive microcontroller management control and sensor functionality using specially designed laboratory equipment; MET students will have new lab experiments to help visualize abstract statics and dynamics concepts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's interdisciplinary approach will not only better prepare students for the knowledge and skills needed for future employment, but also provide significant experience for them to work in teams, a valuable experience for today's industry needs. The project can also serve as a model for interdisciplinary curriculum/laboratory development nationwide.</AbstractNarration>
