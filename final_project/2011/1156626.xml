    <AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at the Bermuda Institute for Ocean Sciences (BIOS). The REU Site provides hands-on research experiences for undergraduates. Students conduct independent research projects based on a variety of marine and open ocean science topics ranging from the molecular to macro scale processes. Many of the research projects fall within the framework of the numerous long-term deep ocean programs conducted at BIOS including Hydrostation 'S', the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS), the Microbial Observatory, the Ocean Flux Program (OFP), and the Ocean Carbon and Climate Change Program. Students also have opportunities to focus on near-shore processes (e.g., water and air pollution, coral reef ecology, marine biodiversity), topics within the Oceans and Human Health Program (e.g., cancer and aging), and topics within the Risk Prediction Initiative (e.g., ocean:atmosphere-based catastrophe models such as those used to predict hurricanes and/or intense rainfall events). Students participate in weekly activities (e.g., REU student seminars, visits to the aquarium and biological conservation/restoration sites) and frequently join BIOS scientists aboard the R/V Atlantic Explorer. Since BIOS is a small campus, REU students have ample opportunity to get to know faculty/staff. BIOS has many active teaching programs during Fall semester that ensure a diverse student population that includes US students taking semester-long courses as well as US, Canadian, and UK visiting university groups. REU students also have opportunities to work with ocean science students from developing countries as part of the POGO Centre of Excellence in Observational Oceanography. At program end, REU students present a seminar of their work to BIOS staff and write manuscripts in the format of a journal appropriate for publication of each project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support provided by NSF includes funding for student stipends, student travel to and from the site, student housing and meals and some administrative costs.</AbstractNarration>
