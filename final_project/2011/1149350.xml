    <AbstractNarration>A central goal of evolutionary biology is to understand both how new species form and the processes that maintain boundaries between species. This study will investigate the evolutionary genetic patterns of the early versus final stages of reproductive isolation in the fly Drosophila subquinaria. Some females of this species display increased behavioral discrimination both against males of a closely related species as well as against certain males of their own species. This research will test whether the ecological processes and genetic mechanisms that reinforce boundaries between different species can result in behavioral isolation among different populations of the same species. The methods will integrate field studies, genetic mapping, and evolutionary genomic approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This funding will integrate research with teaching and learning to provide research opportunities and to develop educational materials that advance the understanding of evolutionary processes at the broader level. Educational activities will translate the focal ideas of the research into inquiry-based classroom exercises that will help students understand why evolution is important in their daily lives through learning about how it operates and the consequences of evolution in action. Graduate students, undergraduates, and high school teachers will be involved in all aspects of the scientific research, curriculum development, and public outreach.</AbstractNarration>
