    <AbstractNarration>This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This funding establishes a new CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Texas State University - San Marcos focused on mobile cyber-physical systems (Mobile CPSs). The students will develop secure, efficient, and energy-aware mechanisms for various applications using the robots and sensors in the Mobile CPS Lab at the university. Students will be exposed to control and optimization theory as well as new technologies developed for Mobile CPSs. A nationwide recruitment process is used to select cohorts of undergraduate students to participate in a ten-week summer research program at the host institution. Students will be recruited from a wide range of universities, ensuring the participation of women, veterans, and minorities. The project includes mentoring by the experienced computer science faculty members, technical seminars and workshops, student presentations, and field trips and other professional development opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in strong research basis and the expertise of the faculty. The projects are in research areas that are current and address national priorities such as cyber security and sustainability. The students participate in a full range of research activities from preparing research literature reviews to production and dissemination of research results. The project has the potential to add to the emerging research base of cyber-physical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to undergraduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups. The project team is committed to including under-represented minority students in their research. Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning.</AbstractNarration>
