    <AbstractNarration>Glaciers: A Chronology of Climate Change is a CRPA project that seeks to explain the historical cycling of glaciers in the context of climate change. By using chemical isotopes (Beryllium 10), the age of rocks that have been covered with glacier ice and exposed to sunlight later can be determined fairly accurately. Through this method, the glaciation cycles have been determined for the last 70,000 years. In collaboration between the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), this project is designed to impact adult audiences, youth in grades 6th-12th, and teachers writ large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research results shall be expressed via an eight-minute high definition film for large screen viewing in the "Science Bulletins" section of the AMNH and the affiliated museums. A rigorous front-end evaluation will be used to inform the presentation and assess audience impact. Subsequent formative evaluations are designed to measure the learning impact of the film and the retention of longer term concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that more than 700,000 individuals will have access to current, scientifically accurate data and related information on glaciation cycles and climate change through the educational film and website. Materials will be easily accessible to teachers and the film will be closed captioned in both English and Spanish.</AbstractNarration>
