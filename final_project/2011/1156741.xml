    <AbstractNarration>The University of Michigan Interdisciplinary REU Site will provide a research program for ten undergraduates during the summer of 2012. The students will participate in a ten-week interdisciplinary research program focused on studies involving the structure and function of proteins. Student participants will engage in intensive hands-on experimental training and independent investigation in the areas of biochemistry, biophysics, marine biology, molecular biology and plant biology. In addition to research, students will participate in a series of weekly enrichment seminars focusing on scientific communication, graduate school application process, the ethical conduct of research, and scientific career options. Opportunities for integration into the university research community will be provided through periodic networking activities and field trips -- with REU faculty mentors, graduate students, and undergraduate students from other campus summer research programs. The overall REU experience will promote student persistence in the STEM disciplines at the undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate levels. Students will be recruited from across the nation while maintaining an emphasis on providing research opportunities to women, underrepresented minorities, and students from institutions with limited resources for research. Rising sophomores, juniors or seniors majoring in biochemistry, biology, and biophysics or a related discipline will be eligible for participation in the program. Students from outside the host institution will be given priority, as University of Michigan students have ample opportunities to conduct research outside of the REU program. All participants will receive on-campus housing, meal and travel allowances, and a stipend. The program will be assessed by using the common REU assessment tool available at the BIO REU website (www.bioreu.org). Students will be tracked annually over at least five years after completion of the program to determine the long term impact of the REU experience.
