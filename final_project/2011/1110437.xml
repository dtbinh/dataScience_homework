    <AbstractNarration>A gradual change in the reproductive mode has been observed in two lake populations of the freshwater New Zealand snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum. Clonal females dominate deep habitats, while cross-fertilizing males and females dominate the shallow regions. Snails in both lakes are infected by a trematode parasite, Microphallus sp., which sterilizes all individuals, and is more prevalent in shallow regions. A cline in the snail's life history (LH) traits has also been found where shallow-water snails mature at a smaller size than deep-water snails. This project will determine whether the difference in parasite frequency is positively correlated with the frequency of cross-fertilization and with differences in LH traits for snail populations in 20 lakes on the South Island of New Zealand. The PIs will determine reproductive mode, parasite prevalence, and whether resistance to infection can evolve in cross-fertilizing individuals using laboratory experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The P. antipodarum study system is well suited to test important evolutionary theories using field data, providing information on the extent to which parasitism shapes a host population. Moreover, trematode worms are important disease agents in both humans and domesticated animals. According to the World Health Organization, 200 million people are infected by the trematodes that cause Schistosomiasis, which is second to malaria in its public health impact. Nonetheless, little is known about the effects of the snail populations in spreading these worms, which have similar life cycles to the worms studied in this research. Thus, this international, multi-lab investigation should interest organizations that aim to control these diseases.</AbstractNarration>
