    <AbstractNarration>The research topic of this IRES program in Hong Kong is applied mathematics. Ten undergraduate students from the U.S. are selected each year to go to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) where they will collaborate with another group of ten students from Hong Kong and China. The program solicits mathematics-related problems from industry in the area, and the students work on those problems in mixed teams of four students each. Each team has an academic mentor as well as an industrial mentor. Students are encouraged to publish their final reports. The intellectual merit of the program stems primarily from the challenging problems that are identified in an industrial setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international research experience broadens the students? understanding of the world, especially East Asia, and prepares them to engage with international colleagues in the future course of their careers. The PIs makes an effort to include underrepresented minorities, and the experience encourages the participating undergraduates to appreciate research and to continue to graduate school.</AbstractNarration>
