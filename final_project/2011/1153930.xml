    <AbstractNarration>Refractory dissolved organic carbon (RDOC) in the ocean has long been recognized as highly resistant to removal. It has a mean lifetime in the ocean of thousands of years, so it is generally thought of as a recalcitrant pool that is transported mostly conservatively with the thermohaline circulation. But unlike RDOC in the present-day ocean, this vast reservoir has been implicated by paleoceanographic research as a relatively rapid-turnover carbon source/sink involved in past climate changes. Accordingly, the RDOC reservoir in ancient oceans must at times have been much larger than today, and that large reservoir must have been rapidly mobilized to release its carbon to the atmosphere. There is a clear need to understand how RDOC source and sink processes operate in the modern ocean in order to understand its potential role in past or future oceans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a researcher at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami hopes to fill knowledge gaps in the RDOC-climate connection. Inasmuch as mapping of its global distribution was accomplished only within the past few years, few solid facts about processes controlling the RDOC pool have been established. One particularly important RDOC sink is in the northern North Pacific. The PI believes that RDOC carried in bottom waters from the Southern Ocean to the far north is conserved, but once in the vicinity of Pacific Deep Water formation there is a rather abrupt loss of carbon. His immediate goal in this project is to characterize the RDOC sink in the North Pacific, an objective that is one part of the larger goal of understanding the role of ocean RDOC in global climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed studies of the modern ocean carbon cycle will give us new insights on the role of marine DOC in Earth's past and future climates. The topic of this research is also closely related to the principal investigator's current leadership responsibilities in helping to implement the new U.S. Carbon Cycle Science Plan.</AbstractNarration>
