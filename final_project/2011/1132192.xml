    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial funding for an advanced study institute (ASI) on complex systems in physics to be held in Shanghai, China, in June 2012. A team of 12 senior researchers and 24 assistants from the U.S. will join colleagues at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) to offer a two-week hands-on course demonstrating table-top experiments in complex non-linear physical systems. About 70 participants, primarily junior faculty members, will be selected from underdeveloped regions of Central and Southeast Asia. The objective is to demonstrate that interesting and productive experiments can be conducted with relatively inexpensive and available materials. This ASI is a successor to similar programs that have been held in Africa, India, and Brazil. The local expenses will be supported by SJTU, and participant expenses as well as administrative costs are sponsored by the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy.&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will engage leading researchers and well qualified post-doctoral fellows and graduate students with participants from underdeveloped regions in Asia to conduct the table-top experiments as well as to introduce useful computer software to the participants. As has already been demonstrated by the previous Hands-on ASIs, these activities stimulate the curiosity of the participants and raise a variety of interest research questions that they can pursue on their own and in continuing collaborations. In addition to raising research issues in the study of complex phenomena the institute demonstrates useful and effective methods of scientific education. This experience is beneficial to the young U.S. assistants as much as to the Asian participants.</AbstractNarration>
