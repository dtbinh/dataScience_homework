    <AbstractNarration>Objective &lt;br/&gt;This objective of this program is to establish an antenna design and measurement laboratory at the University of North Dakota (UND) through the acquisition of major equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the design of advanced and novel antennas including small antennas for biosensors and microwave imaging, wearable and low power antennas for spacesuits, small spacecraft and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) payload and sensor electronics, and smart multiple antennas for vehicular wireless communication. Each of these active projects has potential for advancement of knowledge. In biomedical microwave imaging and biosensors, a novel method for diagnosis of diseased cells is proposed which is based on wireless biosensors. These sensors need miniaturized biocompatible antennas. At UND the spacesuit group is developing two generations of spacesuits. For communication and health monitoring, there is a need for small efficient antennas. The antenna laboratory will provide means of testing the proposed novel wearable antennas on the suit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;The establishment of this laboratory has significant effects on the training students. The shortage of antenna and radio frequency (RF) engineers with proper experience in today?fs job market calls for putting extra effort in training students in this field. The proposed laboratory gives opportunities to the investigators to expose students to their research and to train them more effectively by integrating different practical examples of their research within the undergraduate/graduate curriculum. In particular, this can impact the attraction and involvement of under-represented female students in the field of RFand antenna design.</AbstractNarration>
