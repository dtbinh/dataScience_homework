    <AbstractNarration>The Fisk University Planning Grant will identify sustainable best-practices to increase student retention, learning success and career interest in STEM at the institution. The specific efforts to achieve this includes undertaking a self-study of it STEM undergraduate programs and research infrastructure using a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis, studying national models for undergraduate research, utilizing evidence-based results to develop and institutional plan. A STEM Knowledge Map will be developed to digital capture the content and objectives of all of the STEM courses and depict the relationships to each other. This tool will help in determining what alignments and modifications will be needed in the STEM programs following the self-study. The planning process will include a synthesis of current knowledge about virtual mentoring and plans will include creation of a virtual mentoring community for FISK STEM students. This self evaluation approach can serve as a model for similar other institutions to utilize in gaining understanding of their STEM programs strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities and how to integrate undergraduate research experiences throughout the curriculum..</AbstractNarration>
