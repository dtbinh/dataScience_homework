    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by recruiting, mentoring, and supporting academically talented, but financially needy, students through degree completion and partnering with employers to facilitate placement. Project objectives are to: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Improve educational opportunities for eligible students pursuing degrees in biological, physical, mathematical, and information sciences or engineering or technology.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Increase retention of students to degree achievement by creating supportive environments through changes in organizational culture and practices.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Improve student support programs by providing mentoring, tutoring, counseling, internships, and placement.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Increase the STEM workforce by implementing the project with industry partners to help meet national needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is providing students with skills that improve academic competitiveness, encouraging them to pursue STEM careers, increasing faculty involvement in mentoring students, nurturing permanent changes in organizational culture and practices, and increasing the economic diversity of the STEM workforce. Project partners include Danfoss Turbocor Compressions, General Dynamics, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. The college is providing release time for faculty to mentor students and STEM tutors for scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project goes beyond increasing the quantity of students in STEM disciplines by advancing knowledge of effective practices that prepare students to pursue STEM careers from community colleges, the fastest growing educational level in the nation, by innovatively integrating student support and placement.</AbstractNarration>
