    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to build a quality research program to develop advanced nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;controllers using artificial neural networks that have assured performance for the emerging ac/dc micro&lt;br/&gt;grids. The proposed research is associated with educational activities and a well-defined plan for&lt;br/&gt;technology transfer to industry. The micro grids comprise of conventional fossil-based generators along&lt;br/&gt;with significant penetration of highly intermittent renewable energy sources as well as storage devices.&lt;br/&gt;The approach is to develop nonlinear models of the proposed micro grids, followed by nonlinear control&lt;br/&gt;schemes leading to assured grid stability. Next, pertinent simulation and hardware implementation of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed controllers will be performed.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. The proposed work shall focus on fundamental challenges of ac/dc micro grids&lt;br/&gt;including proper modeling, centralized and decentralized nonlinear control, and assured stability using&lt;br/&gt;distributed generation, FACTS devices and storage. Moreover, the PI will develop new undergraduateand&lt;br/&gt;graduate-level courses on ac/dc power systems. Publications in related journals and conferences will&lt;br/&gt;continue.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact. Near and long term impacts of the proposal?s outcomes include allowing widespread&lt;br/&gt;utilization of renewable sources through efficient control designs, technology transfer to industry,&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of the course materials to other institutions, as well as control design for other complex&lt;br/&gt;applications such as Dep. of Trans., wireless networks, etc., through employing the experience obtained&lt;br/&gt;in this work on complex systems control. In addition, a set of outreach activities including engagement of&lt;br/&gt;women and under-represented minorities through Louisiana Student Diversity Programs' office and K-12&lt;br/&gt;outreach are planned</AbstractNarration>
