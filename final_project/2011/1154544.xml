    <AbstractNarration>This project is designed to provide 30 need-based scholarships for academically talented undergraduates majoring in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth and Environmental Sciences, or Mathematics at the college. Three cohorts of students are being recruited through site visits, partnerships with high schools, open houses, and electronic networking. Selection of applicants is based upon aptitude for success and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Students in each cohort live in the same residence hall, take classes together, and engage in collaborative, multidisciplinary research. Faculty and Career Services specialists are creating workshops and a network of STEM professionals to assist students with career placement. Annual surveys and interviews with recipients explore attitudes about academic support, advising, teaching, and depth of commitment to STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Adapting methods used in successful cohort programs at the college, the project focuses on small-group and inquiry-based learning. Improved educational opportunities include individualized mentoring, early research training, utilization of modern laboratory and computing equipment, and the use of the college marine research vessel. These opportunities provide scholarship recipients with educational experiences that leverage them into STEM related employment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project contributes to a broad understanding of how to attract and, especially, how to retain academically talented students in STEM disciplines at a small, private liberal arts college. Recent graduates in STEM majors at the college include 18% minorities and 65% women. Thus, this project builds on a college program designed to assure the participation of historically underrepresented groups. The project culminates in a state-wide conference at the college to share findings on retention with the STEM community.</AbstractNarration>
