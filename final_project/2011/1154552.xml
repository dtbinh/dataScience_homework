    <AbstractNarration>West Los Angeles College's "Riding the Road Map to Transfer" (RRMT) program is providing approximately 78 S-STEM scholarships over five years to students in biology, chemistry, geology/earth sciences, and physics/astronomy. The goal of RRMT is to use high impact activities to engage, graduate, and transfer highly motivated, predominately African American and Latino STEM students. RRMT student scholars are (1) receiving financial aid, transfer and career counseling, faculty mentoring, and presentations by invited scientists; (2) participating in internships; (3) developing e-portfolios; and (4) building their knowledge of research techniques, methodologies, and the application of science through undergraduate research projects and targeted field experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RRMT's intellectual merit includes: (a) drawing students from and exploring the relationships between the four basic broad disciplines while reinforcing fundamental scientific principles and (b) engaging with a diverse faculty from different disciplines through laboratory exercises, outside-of-class experimental and research investigations, mentoring, exposure to scientific meetings, and interactions with science in the workplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of RRMT is the direct enhancement of the diversity of the STEM student body at regional universities and the larger STEM workforce in Los Angeles. RRMT leverages the college's TRIO SSS, EOC, and UB programs to recruit and support talented, motivated, and financially needy minority students into STEM fields. Project findings are being used to expand the college's understanding of how to support low-income underrepresented STEM students and are made available to the larger STEM academic community through the project website and presentations at regional and national meetings.</AbstractNarration>
