    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the development and publication of a policy report and a special edition of a peer-reviewed journal to disseminate the findings of an OECD-NSF workshop on Building a Smarter Health and Wellness Future. The report will analyze how technological developments such as high-speed and mobile applications, sensor-based devices, and electronic health records can support new models of care to address 21st century health and wellness needs, reflecting a vision of a patient-centered, rapidly learning healthcare system. It will consider the challenges encountered in redesigning processes of car, the socio-technical and usability factors, access and privacy issues, the sustainability of the new models and their impacts. The special edition will include renowned experts from the United States and Europe. The special edition journal, which will be published online, has an international readership and is recognized for its high impact and extensive citation. The publications provide a way to engage a broad international audience and go beyond describing current trends to focus on governance issues and policies, looking to promote the most efficient and effective roles for both the public and private sectors in sustaining health care innovation.</AbstractNarration>
