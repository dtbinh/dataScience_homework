The major components of the workshop include presentations on NSF proposal guideline and proposal writing, experience sharing, mock panels, and proposal clinic. The workshop intends to provide young faculty with skills in proposal writing, panel review experience, and opportunities to interact with NSF program directors and recent NSF CAREER awardees. This workshop will also provide travel support to encourage junior faculty members at HBCU/MEI to participate the NSF CAREER proposal writing practice.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major activities of the workshop include: presentations by NSF program directors, invited speakers, and recent NSF CAREER awardees; mock panel review sessions; interactions among workshop participants, NSF program directors, and recent NSF CAREER awardees; and proposal clinic.
