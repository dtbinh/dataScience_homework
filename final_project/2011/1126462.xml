    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor Jennifer Hampton from Hope College and colleague Mary Anderson will acquire an atomic force microscope. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) exploration of underlying physical and chemical forces directing the assembly of asymmetrically-shaped particles, (b) study of the morphology and surface functionalization of intermetallic thin films and particles fabricated by solution-phase solid-state chemistry methods, and (c) investigation of controlled nucleation and crystal growth based on underlying thin organic films that are assembled on curved surfaces and within constrained geometries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An atomic force microscope is used to characterize surface topography on a nanoscale level, distinguish different molecular coverage on surfaces, unfold polymers, calculate substrate stiffness, and quantify interaction forces. The AFM generally has a cantilever with a sharp point at its end used to scan the specimen surface. When the tip is brought into proximity of a sample surface, forces between the tip and the sample lead to a deflection of the cantilever. This deflection is often measured using a laser spot reflected from the top surface of the cantilever into a detector. This instrument will be used not only in research but also for research training of students and for outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
