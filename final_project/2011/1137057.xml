    <AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports William Eckenhoff of Rochester University as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Eckenhoff will work on studying the photocatalytic activity of molybdenum and tungsten dithiolate complexes for the reduction of water to hydrogen. The PI will collaborate with scientists at the 'Powering the Planet' Center for Chemical Innovation. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop inexpensive, efficient photocatalysts for the generation of hydrogen fuel. For his plan for broadening participation, Dr. Eckenhoff will participate in a number of activities (including the American Chemical Society's Project SEED) which are specifically aimed at mentoring high-school age students from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr. Eckenhoff is aimed at developing improved photocatalysts for water reduction - to enable the generation of chemical fuel from water and sunlight. The results of research like this can help society come up with energy alternatives to fossil fuels. The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Eckenhoff are aimed at encouraging young people from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
