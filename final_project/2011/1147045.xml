    <AbstractNarration>Flower maturation is critical for plant reproduction because it ensures coordinated maturation of female and male reproductive organs as well as floral display that attracts pollinators. The Arabidopsis transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 6 (ARF6) and ARF8 regulate these complex processes by promoting petal expansion, male and female organ maturation and other processes. This project will identify floral genes directly regulated by ARF6 and ARF8, determine their effects on chromatin modifications that influence gene expression, and identify other transcription factors that act together with ARF6 and ARF8. By understanding the functions of ARF6 and ARF8 in flower maturation the project will provide general insights into regulation of coordinated developmental processes. The research may also inform strategies to optimize seed or fruit production in the face of declining pollinator populations. The project will provide scientific training for postdoctoral fellows and students and will produce an interactive 30-minute multimedia presentation for schoolchildren and the general public. Produced in collaboration with the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center at the University of North Carolina, this presentation will educate the public about genetics and flower function and will be presented daily in the summer months. The project will generate extensive genome binding and gene expression data that will be published and deposited in the public NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database. Plant materials generated in the project will be deposited in the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center.</AbstractNarration>
