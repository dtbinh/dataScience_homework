    <AbstractNarration>These funds support participation of graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and young&lt;br/&gt;investigators at the International Conference on Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry&lt;br/&gt;(ICCPB 2011), to be held in Nagoya, Japan. Participants will build world-wide connections and&lt;br/&gt;gain cross-cultural exposure to institutions interested in global environmental effects on animals.&lt;br/&gt;Advances in understanding how animals adapt to environmental changes will support goals of&lt;br/&gt;safeguarding biodiversity at all levels. Funds will support individuals who have demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;exceptional aptitude and potential for advancing the field of epithelial fluid and solute dynamics&lt;br/&gt;and its regulation. A select group of individuals will present talks in a symposium focusing on&lt;br/&gt;concepts essential to understanding the role of epithelia in water and solute balance this&lt;br/&gt;balance has an overarching role in maintaining all life's basic functions. Epithelia are found in all&lt;br/&gt;organs, and exist as sheets of cells, assembled together by precisely arranged junctional proteins&lt;br/&gt;that lie between cells. Notably, the dynamics of water and solute flows through cells of the&lt;br/&gt;epithelial sheet are highly integrated with flows through junctions of the epithelial sheet, in a&lt;br/&gt;regulated, but poorly understood fashion. The symposium speakers will stress the importance of&lt;br/&gt;how and why cell-to-cell contact and plasticity of these systems are fundamental to appropriate&lt;br/&gt;tissue water and solute dynamics for all vertebrates. Other individuals supported by this grant&lt;br/&gt;will have the opportunity to present their research findings, face-to-face in poster sessions, with&lt;br/&gt;scientists from nearly every continent who work in widely diverse biological fields. A major goal&lt;br/&gt;will be to identify and select women and individuals of underrepresented ethnic minority&lt;br/&gt;background as recipients of these travel funds. Funding for student and trainee initiatives at&lt;br/&gt;ICCPB 2011 will play a key role in attracting and retaining the brightest and best-trained&lt;br/&gt;comparative physiologists.</AbstractNarration>
