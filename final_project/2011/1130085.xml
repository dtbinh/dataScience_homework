    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this grant is to support US based graduate students for traveling to and attending the ACM MobiCom 2011 conference to be held in Las Vegas, Nevada on September 19-23, 2011. MobiCom is a premier conference that serves as a meeting point of researchers from academia and industry, as well as practitioners in different fields of wireless networking and mobile computing. In conjunction with the main conference, MobiCom 2011 will also host several workshops and tutorials on topics of emerging interest. The NSF travel grant will allow a diverse set of students from US institutions to participate in this forum and gain valuable experience by interacting with senior researchers as well as peers in this field. Such interactions and exposure can positively influence the quality of the students' individual research and professional growth, in turn shaping the future of wireless networking and mobile computing technology.</AbstractNarration>
