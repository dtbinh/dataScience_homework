    <AbstractNarration>The University of Nebraska will host a two-day Conference on Mathematical Ecology, to take place in Lincoln, Nebraska on April 14-15, 2012. The conference theme is Population Dynamics and will be held in conjunction with the Howard Rowlee Lecture, an endowed public lecture intended for a general audience, presented annually by the Department of Mathematics. The 2012 Rowlee address will be given on April 13, 2012 by Mark Lewis, Professor of Mathematics and Biology at the University of Alberta. This conference will present an efficient interdisciplinary overview of current state-of-the-art research in population ecology, and will focus on the interplay between modeling, data collection, parameter estimation, numerical simulation, and mathematical analysis. The conference will feature 15 half-hour presentations by some of the most distinguished researchers in the field, a poster session, three organized 40-minute discussion times, and evening activities to encourage informal interactions. The conference will foster contacts between mathematicians and ecologists, and between early-career researchers and eminent researchers, encouraging new ideas and collaborations. Financial support will be used for partial support of travel and lodging for the participants, primarily for students and researchers in the early stages of their careers, and is intended to make the conference as accessible as possible to a diverse group of researchers.</AbstractNarration>
