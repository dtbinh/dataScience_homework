    <AbstractNarration>The Stanford Medical Youth Science Program (SMYSP) began in 1988 as a student-directed program with strong faculty and Stanford support. SMYSP aims to increase knowledge about the sciences and health professions and to offer guidance about the college admissions process to low-income and underrepresented minority students in the communities they serve. SMYSP provides value by supporting Stanford's outreach efforts to academically talented low-income and minority high school students through its university- and school-based programs, raising the awareness of Stanford in diverse communities. Of the over 500 alumni who have graduated from the Summer Residential Program, 99% have been admitted to colleges and universities. Over 40% of the four-year college graduates are in the process of becoming or have become health professionals.</AbstractNarration>
