    <AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for US participants in the "Tenth International Conference on Mathematical and Numerical Aspects of Waves (Waves 2011)," held 25-29 July 2011 at the Simon Fraser University Vancouver campus, BC, Canada. The meeting focuses on mathematical developments in the theory of wave propagation and its applications. Themes for the meeting include forward and inverse scattering, fast computational techniques, approximate boundary conditions, domain decomposition, nonlinear wave phenomena, water waves and coastal modeling, guided waves and random media, and medical and seismic imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is a satellite conference of the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 2011), held in Vancouver the preceding week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to invited talks, the meeting includes invited minisymposia, a poster session to showcase student achievements, tutorial lectures for graduate students, and an "Industry Meet-and-Greet" to enhance interactions between academic researchers and representatives from interested companies. The conference encourages and supports participation by graduate students, junior researchers, and members of under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://www.sfu.ca/WAVES/</AbstractNarration>
