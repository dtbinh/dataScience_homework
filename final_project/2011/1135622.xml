    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide participant support for early career scientists and graduate students to participate in the 2nd CCAPP Symposium "Unraveling the Nature of the Universe with Current and Future Datasets." The Symposium, hosted by the Ohio State University's Center for Cosmology and Astro-Particle Physics (CCAPP), will be held on April 4th - 6th, 2011. The symposium will combine plenary session overview talks on astro-particle physics, cosmology, and space science, with four workshops targeted at in depth discussions of more specialized recent topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, the symposium has a particular focus on early career scientists, graduate students, and local undergraduate students. In advertising the symposium the organizers have targeted especially women and minority groups. To make the symposium more accessible to the general public they have integrated a public lecture by one of the key-note speakers into the schedule.</AbstractNarration>
