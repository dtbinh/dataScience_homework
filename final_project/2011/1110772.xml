    <AbstractNarration>The existence of social monogamy (when a male and a female live together) has long puzzled researchers since both sexes usually gain more reproductive success by mating with multiple partners. This raises the question: under what conditions will monogamy provide reproductive advantages? The proposed research seeks to test three hypotheses that may explain the evolution of social monogamy in the mantis shrimp Pullosquilla litoralis: even spatial distribution of females, equal sex ratio between males and females, and the need for biparental care. It also tests the effects of even female spatial distribution and sex ratio on genetic monogamy (how many males sire each egg clutch) of P. litoralis to discover, how social mating systems and genetic mating systems interact to shape reproductive behaviors?.&lt;br/&gt;P. litoralis is a mantis shrimp that lives in pairs in burrows in sandy marine substrates where both males and females care for eggs by aerating them and removing fouled eggs. The proposed research will be conducted through field studies and experiments at Lizard Island Research Station, Australia. Field studies and experimentation in the marine lab will examine the effects of female spatial distribution and sex ratio on social monogamy in P. litoralis. Paternity testing will elucidate the effects of these factors on genetic monogamy. Laboratory experiments will also examine the effects of biparental care on the reproductive success of male and female P. litoralis. Finally, this research will contribute to management strategies for the conservation of marine crustaceans&lt;br/&gt;As charismatic invertebrates, mantis shrimps are excellent ambassadors for the conservation of coral reefs. Co-PI Wright will share her research with the public through K-12 classroom visits, a field blog that will be hosted by the UC Museum of Paleontology in coordination with the Understanding Science initiative, and undergraduate mentorship.</AbstractNarration>
