    <AbstractNarration>The Quantitative Excellence in Science and Technology (QuEST) Scholars program is facilitating the academic success of transfer students who enter the college intending to major in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM). It is designed to (1) create and nurture cohorts of STEM transfer students through specifically designed and carefully monitored academic and social-support activities; and (2) create the College Student Tutors and Resources for Science (C-STARS) peer tutoring program to help students struggling with quantitative subjects presented in STEM courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholarships of up to $8,000 are being offered to transfer students from their initial matriculation as sophomores or juniors through graduation in one of the STEM majors at the college: Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geosciences, Marine Science, Mathematics, or Physics. STEM faculty help select QuEST Scholars based on financial need, academic potential, and demonstrated dedication to a STEM subject. Seven new QuEST Scholars are being chosen in three consecutive academic years; continued funding for each selected Scholar is based on continued financial need, positive academic performance, and progress towards completing a STEM major. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Four STEM faculty members are teamed with the Associate Dean for Institutional Effectiveness to implement the QuEST and C-STARS programs to improve STEM student learning and retention at the college. In their first year, STEM transfer students participate in a new QuEST Seminar course, which focuses on the roll that quantitative materials play in all STEM majors, thereby creating a true cohort over diverse disciplines. In addition, the seminar explores STEM learning strategies, science ethics, interdisciplinary research, and career development. To improve academic success in STEM courses, the project is also creating the C-STARS program, in which carefully screened and continually trained upper level STEM majors assist students who are experiencing difficulty with quantitative elements of STEM courses. C-STARS peer tutors participate in weekly instructional sessions on successful pedagogical approaches. The faculty team is developing the seminar course, increasing QuEST Scholar learning through new support services including study groups, peer mentors, and an intervention network to respond to transfer student needs, and transforming the STEM learning environment for all students by creating the C-STARS peer tutoring program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research-based initiatives, directed by experienced and informed faculty, are helping to improve the retention of transfer students intending to major in STEM areas at the college. The project is broadly disseminating findings from the QuEST Scholars, Seminar, and C-STARS programs to help other institutions enhance STEM student retention at the undergraduate level.</AbstractNarration>
