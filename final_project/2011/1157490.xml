    <AbstractNarration>This award from the National Science Foundation to Florida State University supports the operation of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) for a five year period, 2013-2017. High magnetic fields are a critical tool to the condensed matter physics and materials research communities and increasingly to the chemistry, biology and biomedical communities. The Laboratory provides a User Program for research using high-magnetic-fields at six unique facilities: Steady-State (DC) Resistive Electromagnets, Pulsed Electromagnets, Ultra-Low Temperature, Ion Cyclotron Resonance, Electron Magnetic Resonance, and the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance/Magnetic Resonance Imaging User Facilities. The Facilities are located at three geographically distributed campuses: Florida State University, University of Florida and Los Alamos National Laboratory. Each user program is built around unique magnetic-field capabilities supported by a world-leading scientific expertise. Access to the User Programs is provided on a competitive basis to the most meritorious proposals submitted from an interdisciplinary scientific community spanning materials science, condensed matter physics, magnet technology, chemistry, and biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NHMFL's nationally recognized education and public outreach programs will utilize the laboratory's scientists, infrastructure, and website to target K-12 students, undergraduates and teachers (via the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) and Teachers (RET) programs), and to expand research and mentorship programs for female and minority graduate students and early career scientists that are tailored to advance each individual's career goals. The Laboratory has an updated diversity plan which is designed to play a leadership role in broadening participation.</AbstractNarration>
