    <AbstractNarration>The investigators organize an annual conference on Frontiers in Applied and Computational Mathematics (FACM) on the campus of the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) in Newark, New Jersey. The conferences include the significant participation of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty. The FACM conference series has been organized over the past seven years by the Department of Mathematical Sciences and the Center for Applied Mathematics and Statistics at NJIT. The conference has become a leading forum for the dissemination of research in applied and computational mathematics and applied statistics. The three year conference plan for 2011-2013 is as follows: FACM 2011 (250-300 participants expected) has a focus on wave propagation in acoustics, electromagnetics, fluids and biology. FACM 2012 and 2013 (150-200 participants expected) will be meetings focused on applications in fluid dynamics and biology/biostatistics, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference series brings together mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, engineers, and biologists to share results of their research in applied and computational mathematics and applied statistics. The broader impacts are that significant cross-fertilization takes place during and after the conferences between researchers in different disciplines who use the methods of applied mathematics, statistics and numerical computation. For students and postdocs, this is a major learning experience that helps them with future presentations and research. This experience helps students emulate the quality of these research activities. Past FACM conferences have an excellent record of participation of women and underrepresented minorities, and the PIs are making efforts to continue this trend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The web link for the conference series is: http://m.njit.edu/Events/FACM11</AbstractNarration>
