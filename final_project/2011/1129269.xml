    <AbstractNarration>The University of Washington's Center for Information Assurance and Cybersecurity (CIAC) is supporting three cohorts of graduate students via a new Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program. These students are mastering the new skills required for managing security in the cloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located in one of the top twenty universities in the world, this existing academic program has already produced over 200 graduates in two Information Assurance (IA) programs. The SFS students are participating in research in partnership with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's Cybersecurity directorate; an active Chapter of the Honeynet Project; and the Applied Physics Laboratory work on malware and botnets. Other strengths of the program include: five IA certificates; dozens of adjunct faculty-practitioners offering interdisciplinary cybersecurity courses across campus; and collaboration with Agora and Infragard (FBI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SFS project is having an immediate impact on the cybersecurity capabilities of the federal workforce by providing graduates with expertise in the security of cloud computing and smart grids. More than 50% of the University of Washington student population is female and more than 30% is from ethnically diverse groups; this diversity is reflected in the recruiting efforts. The Center's is actively engaged with organizations instrumental in developing the cloud, including Amazon, Boeing, Booz Allen Hamilton and Microsoft. The program is uniquely positioned to specialize in the management of cloud security.</AbstractNarration>
