    <AbstractNarration>This project aims to build a reliable and efficient communication support for highly mobile ad hoc networks. This type of networks many time are mission or safety critical requiring reliable communication. For an ad hoc network, this problem is especially challenging because two communication nodes may have never encountered before and do not possibly belong to the same organization. Pre-sharing any information between two nodes may not be feasible. This project addresses a number of adversary attacks in highly mobile ad hoc networks, including communication jamming and eavesdropping, by building a supporting communication layer. More precisely, the main research in this project is to design novel schemes to defend against jamming attacks by agilely changing communication channels, and extract physical layer information to build a secure communication channel. The supporting communication layer provides a secure infrastructure for efficient communications. The project applies both theoretical analysis and real experiments to validate the solutions.</AbstractNarration>
