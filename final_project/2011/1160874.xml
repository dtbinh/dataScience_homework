    <AbstractNarration>The project will convene a group of researchers and students from the U.S., Africa, and Asia to catalyze the expansion of a unique international collaborative model of education and research. It will support the participation of environmental, sustainability and community engagement researchers and practitioners focused on improved resilience of environmental systems in developing regions of eastern and southern Africa (Uganda, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa), as well as the Asian highlands of Nepal, Mongolia and Myanmar/Burma. Current and potential international colleagues will participate in a structured writing clinic that aims to focus on: 1) the synthesis of education and research best practices regarding ethical, structural and institutional issues of international collaborations; and 2) the collaborative generation of interdisciplinary research related to community development focused on environmental change and sustainability. Broad environmental research and education interests that underpin the larger workshop include the functioning and resilience of forested ecosystems in developing areas of Africa and Asia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will provide a venue for international collaborators to share their experiences and perspectives on participating in international research and teaching partnerships. It has been the researchers? experience that this approach helps to foster cross-cultural knowledge exchange within a community of trust and equity for all partners. At the same time, the workshop seeks to provide an opportunity for U.S. based scientists, researchers, educators and students to learn from these interactions and to disseminate this knowledge through the development of a special higher education journal issue. Articles and potential topics that will be addressed and disseminated in the special edition journal include: improved teaching and methodological approaches for preparing students to engage in international environmental research and education projects, measuring student learning outcomes from interdisciplinary research experiences, new pedagogies for community and faculty collaboration in environmental sustainability initiatives, and ethics, protocols and practices of cross-disciplinary and international environmental sustainability research. Dissemination will also include presentations at major symposia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will promote interdisciplinary research and education collaborations between U.S. and international colleagues that would have not been possible otherwise. Specifically, it will support the participation of graduate students, beginning investigators, as well as professionals from predominantly four-year institutions. It is anticipated that the workshop will yield information that improves future curricula focusing on environmental sustainability, community engagement and sustainable development. Meeting results and recommendations will be disseminated including: perspectives on interdisciplinary collaboration, best practices regarding student preparation to conduct ethical and responsible international research in a special higher education journal issue as well as through the expansion of our project website and other digital media.</AbstractNarration>
