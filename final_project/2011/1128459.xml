    <AbstractNarration>Objectives: The recent impressive progress in the MBE growth of high-temperature single layer superconductors in oxide heterostructures opens exciting possibilities for novel sensors ? superconducting hot electron nano-bolometers ? that may lead to potential breakthroughs in modern THz sensing and IR fiber communications technologies. This project pursues complex research of nonequilibrium effects in these novel La2CuO4 /La2-xSrxCuO4 heterostructures to establish the foundation for sensing and communication technologies based on unique superconducting nanomaterials with ultra-small electron heat capacity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research plan includes comprehensive, fundamental investigations of the transport properties of the superconducting interface, focusing on critical issues related to the nonequilibrium electron and phonon effects in low-dimensional superconductors and heterostructures. By providing the needed fundamental and technological bases, this program includes design and development of advanced optoelectronic devices, such as ultra-fast detectors, THz mixers, single IR photon counters with outstanding sensitivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed devices have a number of important applications in THZ environmental and industrial monitoring, astrophysics, homeland security, and medicine. If successful, the proposed program will have a strong impact on optical communication and networking, quantum imaging and metrology, quantum optical computing, bio-photonics, and single-molecule spectroscopy. In addition, this research will provide a strong platform for the training and education of students of minority institutions in important areas of growth and characterization of new materials, research and development of novel nanoscaled devices.</AbstractNarration>
