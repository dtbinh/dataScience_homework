    <AbstractNarration>DISSERTATION RESEARCH: The Quantitative Genetics of Sexual Conflict&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the evolution of differences between sexes (sexual dimorphism). Despite often dramatic physical divergence, males and females share the majority of their genes. This creates genetic conflict when selection favors different trait values in the two sexes, because genes that are beneficial for females will be detrimental for males and vice versa. Evolutionary theory predicts that this conflict can be resolved by one of two mechanisms: location of genes with sex-specific benefits on sex chromosomes (sex-linkage) or sex-specific patterns of gene expression. By crossing populations of water striders that differ in both body size and magnitude of sexual dimorphism, this study will quantify sex-linkage and sex-specific patterns of gene expression to determine if they are responsible for the observed variation in sexual dimorphism. Additionally, the project explores the ability of statistical methods to detect the genetic effects, unique to the two predictions, in wild populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Direct involvement of undergraduates is key to the project. While in the laboratory, students will obtain hands on experience conducting scientific research. Although most UCR undergraduates go into health professions, training during this project will prepare them well for these biology based professions. Results from the research will reveal the genetic architecture of sexually dimorphic traits and contribute to the general theories on body size evolution and sexual selection. Further, this project will contribute to the statistical methods available for quantitative genetic analyses of non-laboratory populations. These results can be used to advance livestock improvement programs and determine the genetic basis of sex-specific diseases in humans.</AbstractNarration>
