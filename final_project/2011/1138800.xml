    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides international travel support for U.S. based graduate student participants to attend the 2011 International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2011), which will be held in Vancouver, Canada, on December 11-14, 2011 (http://icdm2011.cs.ualberta.ca/). ICDM has established itself as the world's premier research conference in data mining. It provides an international forum for presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative, practical development experiences. The conference covers all aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software and systems, and applications, as well as related areas such as data management, machine learning and bioinformatics. The conference proceedings are published by IEEE. The conference seeks to continuously advance the state-of-the-art in data mining. With the growth of the Web, the Internet, and data intensive technologies such as Sensor Networks, and Bioinformatics, Data Mining is an extremely important area in Information Technology. Besides the technical program, the conference features workshops, tutorials, panels, data mining contest, and starting this year, the Ph.D. forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A strong representation of U.S. researchers at the Conference is useful in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in this important area. The total number of ICDM participants in the past has been in excess of 500, with a majority of the participants from the U.S., then Europe and Asia. It is expected to provide scholarships to 16 U.S. based graduate student participants. This grant will partially support the travel costs for the U.S. based graduate student participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information of the Ph.D. forum can be found at http://icdm2011.cs.ualberta.ca/phd-forum.php. The award results will be announced at http://icdm2011.cs.ualberta.ca/travel-grants.php.</AbstractNarration>
