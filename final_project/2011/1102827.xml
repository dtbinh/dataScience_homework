    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Sarah Horst is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Colorado. Due to the limitations of in situ measurements of planetary aerosols, and in particular the impossibility of in situ measurements in the cases of the atmospheres of the early Earth and extrasolar planets, laboratory experiments provide a necessary bridge between theoretical models of planetary atmospheres and the reality of their observed properties. The observed compositions of extrasolar planet atmospheres, and the poorly constrained composition of early Earth's atmosphere, indicate that laboratory experiments need to investigate organic molecule and aerosol production for a broader range of gaseous compositions than previously considered. The research proposed here will take advantage of the world-class aerosol simulation and analysis facilities at the University of Colorado to investigate the effect that oxygen has on aerosol formation and composition. This research will also investigate how choice of laboratory energy source affects aerosol formation and composition, which will further our understanding of the biases present in laboratory experiments and allow for more accurate application of the results of laboratory experiments to planetary atmospheres. Dr. Horst's research will improve our understanding of the range of planetary atmospheres where aerosols may form and increase our understanding of how oxygen is incorporated into organic molecules, which may have implications for the origin of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Horst will also work with the Division of Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society and the NASA Science Mission Directorate to host a teacher workshop each year in conjunction with the annual DPS meeting. The teachers that attend the workshop will be paired with a planetary scientist or astronomer to interact with them and their students throughout the following year.</AbstractNarration>
