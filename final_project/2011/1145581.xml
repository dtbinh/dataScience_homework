    <AbstractNarration>Chemical synapses within the brain are specialized cellular junctions that are vastly&lt;br/&gt;intergraded to allow for rapid, highly-specific communication between neurons. Fusion of&lt;br/&gt;neurotransmitter-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane, subsequent release and&lt;br/&gt;activation of postsynaptic receptors executes a phase called exocytosis. To prevent the limited&lt;br/&gt;number of synaptic vesicles from rapid depletion, a secondary system of webbed pathways&lt;br/&gt;replenishes the vesicle pool through several modes known as endocytosis. Although the exocytic&lt;br/&gt;pathway, with its signaling cascade and key proteins are confidently defined, the true nature of&lt;br/&gt;vesicle re-formation is less clear. The proposed study will investigate the molecular mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;of endocytosis using biophysical and electrochemical methods with milli-second time resolution.&lt;br/&gt;We expect that this work will illustrate the functions of several important endocytic proteins in&lt;br/&gt;endocytosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from this work will likely lead to important insights into synaptic vesicle&lt;br/&gt;recycling, which is critical for higher functions of our brain, such as learning and memory. These&lt;br/&gt;results will shed new light on a signaling cascade that defines the hallmark of inter-cellular&lt;br/&gt;communication and aid in identifying aspects of cellular health, thus revealing a deeper&lt;br/&gt;understanding of what functional mechanism(s) are involved in the dominant and most&lt;br/&gt;fundamental endocytic portal. The investigators will also be dedicated to the training of&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate students in scientific research, through discussion in classes and&lt;br/&gt;research in laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
