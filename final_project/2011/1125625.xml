    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This award supports undergraduate and graduate student attendance and participation in the 18th Annual Southeastern Regional Yeast Meeting (SERYM) to be held on the campus of Mississippi State University from March 11-13, 2011. This annual meeting provides a unique opportunity for yeast researchers from states in the southeastern region of the U.S. to come together to share their preliminary research findings and discuss new research tools and emerging technologies. NSF support will be used to cover the travel expenses of student participants in an effort to increase the number of undergraduate and graduate students attending the meeting. Particular emphasis will be placed on strengthening the participation of individuals underrepresented in the sciences through the recruitment of both women and minorities. This meeting, which is expected to attract between 100 and 125 participants, is an ideal venue for the inclusion of student presentations with the ultimate goal of facilitating interactions and discussions between students and senior scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The 2011 SERYM conference brings together scientists studying basic biological processes in fungi by providing a forum for the exchange of research results, ideas and technical expertise. A key strength of this meeting is the opportunity for both undergraduate and graduate students to present their research in oral and poster formats. The regional nature of this meeting provides numerous opportunities for students to discuss their research work with leading scientists, laying the foundation for future scientific development and collaborations. The meeting also provides the undergraduate attendees time to discuss graduate research opportunities directly with potential major professors prior to applying to that program. In addition, the diversity of topics covered exposes students to the current advancements in the field of cell and molecular biology of fungi increasing the educational impact of attendance.</AbstractNarration>
