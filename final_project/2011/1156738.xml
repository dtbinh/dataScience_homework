    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science Foundation supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at University of Memphis. The REU Program will bring ten students to campus for ten weeks each summer for an intensive research experience. These students will synthesize materials with varied properties and potential applications. Theoretical studies of these materials and their properties will complement experimental studies. Other research examples include the synthesis, characterization, and theoretical investigation of bistable photochromic materials for development as optical switches or optical memory devices, the synthesis and characterization of gold nanoparticles for single-cell biosensor applications, and the development and characterization of water-soluble analogs of G protein-coupled receptors, an important class of membrane proteins. The membrane-protein studies would enable alternative strategies for studying the structure and activation mechanisms of this important class of receptors. Results from these and other proposed projects will be disseminated through publications and presentations. Travel funds for REU participants will allow presentations at national and regional meetings during the year following their research experience. An important addition to the current recruiting plan is an expanded effort to enable the participation of students who are parents in this intensive research experience. Therefore, this REU site will broadly impact training in chemistry, the participation of underrepresented minorities, and student parent participation in chemical research. The REU Site will also promote partnerships between the University of Memphis and regional HBCU institutions.</AbstractNarration>
