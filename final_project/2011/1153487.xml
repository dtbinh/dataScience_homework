    <AbstractNarration>This project considers the unification of two view of language: that&lt;br/&gt;from natural language processing and that from linguistic typology.&lt;br/&gt;Our view is that typological information is both useful for solving&lt;br/&gt;real-world natural language processing thats and automatically&lt;br/&gt;derivable from language data. This research first explores how to use&lt;br/&gt;typological knowledge to improve performance on problems such as&lt;br/&gt;dependency parsing and machine translation for low density langauges.&lt;br/&gt;Intuitively, our statistical models waste time exploring a hypothesis&lt;br/&gt;space that is too big: the space of realistic grammars is much smaller&lt;br/&gt;than the space of all grammars. The second part of this research&lt;br/&gt;considers the automatic acquisition and boostrapping of typological&lt;br/&gt;knowledge from raw text. The outcome of this research is: (a)&lt;br/&gt;improved statistical models for hard natural language processing&lt;br/&gt;problems; and (b) a larger library of typological universals that have&lt;br/&gt;been derived automatically from data. Our outcomes are empirically&lt;br/&gt;evaluated on the raw language processing tasks and in terms of the&lt;br/&gt;quality of the universal implications mined from data, but comparing&lt;br/&gt;them with known repositories of universals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our results will impact the fields of natural language processing and linguistics. From the research side, this research will find applications in a wider variety of problems than the ones we intend to study; in particular, the use of linguistic universals in natural language processing technology&lt;br/&gt;will fundamentally change the way multilinguality is addressed in this&lt;br/&gt;field. From a linguistics perspective, the goal of this project is to&lt;br/&gt;shed new light on linguistic universals. This should impact not only&lt;br/&gt;the area of typology, but also the study and preservation of&lt;br/&gt;endangered languages. By automatically identifying typological&lt;br/&gt;features and implications from data, the process of documenting&lt;br/&gt;endangered languages could be made more efficient: leading to a&lt;br/&gt;smaller loss of knowledge of these languages.</AbstractNarration>
