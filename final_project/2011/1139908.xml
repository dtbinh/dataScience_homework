    <AbstractNarration>The University System of Maryland (USM) Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) will&lt;br/&gt;build upon its success of training and educating Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Fellows by proposing&lt;br/&gt;a program for a sixth cohort. The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) is the lead institution&lt;br/&gt;of a senior-level LSAMP and has been designated as the BD site for 2011-2013. UMBC is dedicated to&lt;br/&gt;recruiting, retaining, educating, and training underrepresented students in science, technology,&lt;br/&gt;engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, and preparing them for success in the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;UMBC welcomed its first cohort of BD Fellows in 2005. Three of those Fellows completed Ph.D.s during&lt;br/&gt;2010-2011. Others from that cohort are persisting in doctoral programs (full-time and part-time) or have&lt;br/&gt;received M.S. degrees and remain in touch with UMBC's BD Program as they plan to return for the&lt;br/&gt;doctorate. (One 2005 BD Fellow is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Utah, and another will begin the&lt;br/&gt;D.Eng. program at Morgan State University in fall 2011.) The USM has four additional cohorts of fellows&lt;br/&gt;on both the UMBC and the University of Maryland, College Park campuses. The Fellows connect with&lt;br/&gt;one another at BD training, professional development, and community building events. The USM LSAMP&lt;br/&gt;began in 1995 and has been vigilant about increasing the number of underrepresented minority&lt;br/&gt;baccalaureate degree recipients in STEM disciplines. The BD award will enable us to strengthen both our&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate pipelines and create an expanded community of scholars within these&lt;br/&gt;disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;Plans for the 2011-2013 cohort include activities that will begin during the fellows' first week on campus.&lt;br/&gt;The program includes extensive orientation activities such as a 2-day Summer Success Institute, the&lt;br/&gt;Graduate School Orientation, and multi-day orientations with faculty within the STEM departments. In the&lt;br/&gt;first year, the Fellows will be assigned a Peer Mentor; apply for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship;&lt;br/&gt;receive training in public speaking; and complete a 30-50 page research preparation project that will&lt;br/&gt;require them to network with other graduate students, faculty, and BD Fellows at universities outside of&lt;br/&gt;the USM. Throughout the two years, BD Fellows will participate in bi-weekly BD meetings, attend&lt;br/&gt;monthly Graduate Student Success Seminars, and participate in academic and professional development&lt;br/&gt;seminars with other graduate students and faculty. By the end of the second year, the BD Fellows will&lt;br/&gt;have learned and implemented methodologies for achieving academic excellence, completed credits for&lt;br/&gt;the M.S. degree or early qualifying milestones toward the doctorate (varies according to department),&lt;br/&gt;completed 10 hours of UMBC's "Professors-in-Training" modules, presented at two research conferences,&lt;br/&gt;participated in numerous networking opportunities with faculty, attended workshops on thesis completion&lt;br/&gt;and dissertation proposal planning, and developed a plan for persisting to finish the doctorate.</AbstractNarration>
