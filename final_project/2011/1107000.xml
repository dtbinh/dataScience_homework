    <AbstractNarration>The proposal focuses on Markov random fields and directed graphical&lt;br/&gt;models, classes of statistical models that are based on a marriage&lt;br/&gt;between graph theory and probability theory, and allow for flexible&lt;br/&gt;modeling of network-structured data. The core of the proposal&lt;br/&gt;consists of multiple research thrusts, all centered around the goal of&lt;br/&gt;developing practical algorithms and theory for statistical estimation&lt;br/&gt;with network-structured data. One research thrust concerns various&lt;br/&gt;issues associated with model selection in undirected graphical models,&lt;br/&gt;also known as Gibbs distributions or Markov random fields. Problems&lt;br/&gt;include determining the information-theoretic limitations of graphical&lt;br/&gt;model selection in high dimensions (where the number of vertices may&lt;br/&gt;be larger than the sample size), not only for i.i.d. data but also&lt;br/&gt;dependent data; developing methods for tracking sequences of networks&lt;br/&gt;that evolve over time; and developing methods for data with hidden&lt;br/&gt;variables. Another research thrust concerns various statistical&lt;br/&gt;problems associated with directed acyclic graphical structures (DAGs),&lt;br/&gt;including estimating equivalence classes of DAGs in the&lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional setting; estimating causal relationships via designed&lt;br/&gt;interventions; and efficient computational methods for DAG selection&lt;br/&gt;using the Lasso and related methods. Overall, the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;is inter-disciplinary in nature, drawing on techniques from&lt;br/&gt;mathematical statistics, convex optimization, information theory,&lt;br/&gt;concentration of measure, and graph theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science and engineering abounds with different types of networks.&lt;br/&gt;Examples include social networks such as FaceBook and Twitter,&lt;br/&gt;networks of genes and proteins in molecular biology, network models&lt;br/&gt;for economic and market dynamics, neural networks in brain imaging,&lt;br/&gt;networks of disease transmission in epidemiology, and information&lt;br/&gt;networks in law enforcement. In the real-world, the structure of the&lt;br/&gt;underlying network is not known, but instead one observes samples of&lt;br/&gt;the network behavior (e.g., packet counts in a computer network;&lt;br/&gt;instances of infection at given time instances of an epidemic; emails&lt;br/&gt;or text messages sent among a group of people), and the goal is to&lt;br/&gt;infer the network structure. Methods for solving this network&lt;br/&gt;inference problem have a broad range of applications. Examples&lt;br/&gt;include inferring brain connectivity and disease etiology in&lt;br/&gt;neuroimaging studies, detecting terrorist cells in social networks,&lt;br/&gt;monitoring intrusions in computer networks, and understanding the&lt;br/&gt;basis of gene-protein interactions in systems biology.</AbstractNarration>
