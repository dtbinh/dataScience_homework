    <AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) that will support ten undergraduate Fellows (rising seniors) annually for a 10-12 week summer internship program. Individual student research projects and the associated one-on-one mentorship with one or more members of the WHOI scientific and senior technical staff are the heart of the WHOI REU program. Another component of the program is the summer lecture series, which is designed for the Fellows and attended by all of them. The talks provide an introduction to the wide range of current research at WHOI, and an appreciation of how individual research efforts and interdisciplinary projects can advance our understanding of the oceans. The program also includes a half-day Ethics in Science workshop, and the opportunity to take part in the full range of academic and social activities available during the summer in Woods Hole. Finally, WHOI provides an at-sea experience for all Fellows on WHOI's coastal research vessel, R.V. Tioga. At the end of the summer, each Fellow prepares a written report describing their research, and makes a public oral presentation of their research results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support provided by NSF includes funding for student stipends, student travel to and from the site, student housing and meals and some administrative costs.</AbstractNarration>
