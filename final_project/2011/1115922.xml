    <AbstractNarration>This project provides support for promoting student research on symbolic computation and computational mathematics at the 17th International Conference on Applications of Computer Algebra (ACA 2011), which is hosted by Lamar University and held in Houston, Texas, on June 27-30, 2011. In the past several years there has been a dramatic increase in the use of algebraic and symbolic computation in engineering, science and education. The ACA series of annual conferences is devoted to stimulating and enhancing this important progress through international meetings that emphasize theoretical research and algorithm design for software development, as well as the applications of algebraic and symbolic computation in engineering, physical and medical sciences, pure and applied mathematics, and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ACA conferences traditionally work to ensure the future vitality of the application fields of algebraic and symbolic computation by facilitating development and nurturing of a community of capable graduate students and entry-level scientists. Through keynote speakers, talks, themed workshops, timely and topical tutorials, this conference provides mechanisms for graduate students and young scientists to meet each other in a scientifically rigorous setting. With researchers coming from all around the world, this conference makes a broad impact on both the algebraic and symbolic computation research community and the user community. Leading software companies such as MapleSoft and Wolfram Research have been regularly attending ACA meetings.</AbstractNarration>
