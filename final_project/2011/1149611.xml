    <AbstractNarration>In a rapidly developing emergency situation the timely discovery of discovery of information about the inside of a building, such as temperature during a fire, is key to a successful response. A challenge is that the needed sensors are difficult to deploy and maintain in these situations. While robots can be used to gather some information, considerations of deployment logistics, dynamic environment, infrastructural dependence, reliability, and speed have limited their adoption. To address these problems, this project explores a novel approach of using a collection of simple controlled mobile air vehicles with sensors (SensorFly). By taking a minimalistic approach, where each device has few sensors, the SensorFly project will develop a basic understanding of such controlled-mobile networked systems, including trade-offs between per device capability and system capability, and low-level collaborative techniques to counter system non-determinism. To test models and evaluate different approaches, the project builds on testbeds involving SensorFly nodes, a low-cost 30-gram flying sensor node.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SensorFly project has the potential for broad social impact. Studies that improve information gathering in emergency situations will improve safety for both the responders and building occupants. Although the size and weight of available sensors and platforms may decrease over time, the application of minimal mobile sensing platforms will remain attractive due to their reduced intrusiveness. Therefore, the investigation into minimalistic approaches will have a lasting impact that extends beyond today's sensing systems. Finally, the project continues the PI's efforts for advising students in research and encouraging members of under-represented groups into science and engineering fields.</AbstractNarration>
