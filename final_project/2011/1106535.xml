    <AbstractNarration>An important objective of the proposed research is to &lt;br/&gt;develop methods for gene mapping, i.e., the identification &lt;br/&gt;of genomic regions containing a gene (or genes) affecting &lt;br/&gt;a trait of interest in either humans or in experimental organisms. &lt;br/&gt;Searching a parameter set for the location of one or more &lt;br/&gt;signals in a noisy background arise in gene mapping where the &lt;br/&gt;signals indicate the presence of a gene. Similar problems arise &lt;br/&gt;in brain mapping, astronomy, and bioinformatics. An important &lt;br/&gt;part of their solution involves the probability that a random field &lt;br/&gt;exceeds a high threshold. A unified analytic approach and &lt;br/&gt;sequential Monte Carlo methods will be developed to evaluate &lt;br/&gt;these boundary crossing probabilities. Other methodological &lt;br/&gt;innovations of the proposed research are new dynamic empirical &lt;br/&gt;Bayes models and methods, sequential surveillance procedures, &lt;br/&gt;and adaptive control schemes for input-output systems that may &lt;br/&gt;undergo occasional abrupt structural changes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamic empirical Bayes approach under development has &lt;br/&gt;applications to insurance rate-making, dynamic panel data in &lt;br/&gt;economics, longitudinal data in biomedical studies, and risk &lt;br/&gt;management. Sequential surveillance and adaptive risk control &lt;br/&gt;are of timely relevance in the aftermath of the recent financial &lt;br/&gt;crisis and oil spill disaster. Sequential Monte Carlo methods have &lt;br/&gt;important applications to nonlinear filtering and to rare event &lt;br/&gt;simulation in communication networks and risk management. Gene &lt;br/&gt;mapping provides an important tool in the study of human diseases, &lt;br/&gt;and in agriculture and animal husbandry. The broader implications &lt;br/&gt;of the proposed research include (i) direct implications in genetics, &lt;br/&gt;engineering, finance, insurance, risk management and surveillance, &lt;br/&gt;and (ii) training of the next generation of scientists in academia, &lt;br/&gt;industry, and government by developing new advanced courses and &lt;br/&gt;involving graduate students in all phases of the research.</AbstractNarration>
