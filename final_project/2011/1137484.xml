    <AbstractNarration>Tennessee State University's (TSU) Targeted Infusion Project entitled - Development of an Undergraduate Bioinformatics Program for Enhancing Research and Education at Tennessee State - has the goal to develop an undergraduate Bioinformatics program at the university. This project will initiate interdisciplinary research in the areas of bioinformatics, database design and data mining, development of data structures and algorithms for bio-information processing, and development of novel high-performance computation techniques for analyzing the structures and functions coded in molecular sequences. TSU has demonstrated growing research strength in genomics. The project will provide resources for further development of genome research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be an integral part in preparing a workforce of minority students who can compete with their peers in industry or academia in various areas of bioinformatics. The activities will enhance integration of research and education in disciplines such as biology, mathematics, and computer science. The addition of a Bioinformatics Laboratory will equip TSU with facilities that can host outreach opportunities. These activities are expected to increase interest in science and engineering, therefore increasing the recruitment and retention rates at TSU.</AbstractNarration>
