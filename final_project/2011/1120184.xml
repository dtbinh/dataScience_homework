    <AbstractNarration>This project is focused on developing useful new catalytic ring forming reactions. A detailed plan is put forth to utilize mechanistic insights to design new catalysts for the ring expansion of strained heterocyclic synthons. The information gained from these catalyst design and development studies will be used to build chiral variants of the optimal ligand frameworks. The resulting new chiral catalysts will be used for asymmetric desymmetrizations and kinetic resolutions. Concurrently, new and efficient synthetic routes for assembling these heterocyclic synthons will be developed. This will be accomplished in one pot by adding carbon nucleophiles to uniquely activated carbonyl electrophiles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Jon T. Njardarson of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University. Professor Njardarson's research efforts revolve around the development of new and useful methods for building valuable heterocyclic frameworks. Successful advancement of these new synthetic methods will provide access to a wide range of important heterocyclic products, which will benefit researchers both in academia and the pharmaceutical industry.</AbstractNarration>
