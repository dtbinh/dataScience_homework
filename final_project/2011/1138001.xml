    <AbstractNarration>Continental Scientific Drilling (CSD) has a long history producing transformative science. In 1984, the CSD community formed a non-profit corporation, DOSECC, to encourage and nurture community efforts to develop CSD projects, prepare drilling plans and budgets, design and fabricate equipment, and conduct scientific drilling operations. In addition, since 1997 the CSD community, through DOSECC, has conducted annual workshops. The CSD community is large and has diverse interests, but significant barriers hinder implementing of projects: technical hurdles in planning and budgeting projects, difficulties in implementing and managing drilling operations, and uncertain funding. Growth and cohesion of the US scientific drilling community is also important for maintaining national competitiveness and participation in the International Continental Scientific Drilling (ICDP) Program. This workshop will address these issues by gathering scientists of diverse background and research focus to learn from the successes and challenges of recent CSD projects, discuss collaboration opportunities, and chart the course of the future of continental scientific drilling in the U.S. This will be accomplished through keynote presentations on recent CSD projects and disciplinary breakout sessions to create a vision for future theme-based workshops. The workshop findings will be gathered in a report that will be distributed widely through print and electronic forms.</AbstractNarration>
