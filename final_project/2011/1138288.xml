    <AbstractNarration>Astronomy is a fully international endeavor. To participate in the international scientific community, American researchers must meet and collaborate with researchers from around the world, and to do this they must attend international scientific meetings. These meetings provide a forum for interacting with other researchers, forming collaborations, presenting new results and participating in the international scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide support for US astronomers, postdocs, and students to participate in international professional meetings. The award will cover three years of travel grants, including a large number of grants (approximately 120) that will support travel to the IAU General Assembly which will be held in Beijing, China in 2012. This award will be especially important to early-career researchers and those from less-endowed institutions as it will help give them the opportunity to actively participate in these important meetings.</AbstractNarration>
