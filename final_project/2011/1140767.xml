    <AbstractNarration>At Calvin College faculty from Biology, Chemistry, and Mathematics and Computer Science are collaborating to reform the four courses of the introductory biology sequence to align with the findings of the document "Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action." Building on problem-based learning in the first course, they are now developing laboratory modules, derived from faculty research, in the middle two courses, which culminate in student research projects in the fourth course. The three-week laboratory modules develop students' abilities to read and critique the scientific literature, to frame scientific questions and to seek their experimental answers, and to learn the conventions of oral and written communication of scientific results. Like genuine research projects, the modules include quantitative and interdisciplinary features, so students are less inclined to see their STEM courses as isolated from one another. The lecture aspects of the courses have also been revised to be more student-centered and interactive, making use of the best ideas in pedagogy. Participating in the review and testing of this strategic reform are partners from two universities, four liberal arts colleges, and a community college, all of whom have collaborated with Calvin College on previous projects. Grand Rapids Community College contributes an external collaborator, a biologist, who receives a stipend for carrying out review, testing, and evaluation of the modules, as do the other collaborators. By following the blueprint of "Vision and Change" for reform of classroom, laboratory, and assessment practices, Calvin College's project is sure to have a broad impact on undergraduate biology education.</AbstractNarration>
