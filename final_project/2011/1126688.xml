    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 11-26688&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Yang, Mei&lt;br/&gt; Jiang, Yingtao; Qi, Minghao&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Nevada, Las Vegas&lt;br/&gt;Title: MRI/Dev.: Highly Scalable and Reconfigurable Testbed in Support of Future Many-Core and System-on-Chip Research and Design Exploration&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project from an EPSCoR state, aiming to develop a highly scalable and reconfigurable multi-board-based testbed which can emulate and validate future large-scale many-core and system-on-chip systems, enhances the future for design of multi-core systems. Specifically, this testbed efficiently and effectively emulates all the functionalities that are perceived at both the network-on-chip (NoC) and the full-system levels. The proposed work establishes a high performance, multi-core testbed in Nevada, enabling the following research projects in system-on-chip design:&lt;br/&gt;- Emulation of new computer architecture designs,&lt;br/&gt;- Design space exploration for NoC-based many-core designs,&lt;br/&gt;- Emulation of hybrid photonic-electronic NoC architectures, and&lt;br/&gt;- Traffic modeling and benchmark development.&lt;br/&gt;The work aims to develop a flexible testbed for NoC architectures seen to be key to the future of multiprocessor design. In recent years, computer architecture speed-ups have begun to rely exclusively on multi-core paradigms instead of faster cores. There is a general consensus that these many cores have to be linked together through a functionally correct, power-efficient, and reliable on-chip communication architecture, now widely known as network-on-chip. Testbeds of this type are critical to economic vitality in the computer industry.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This instrumentation should provide a unique research facility for faculty and graduate students to conduct research on NoC architecture technology and education. The testbed will be made available to researchers around the country through a cyberinfrastructure remote access mechanism. The proposed testbed enhances Ph.D. production in an EPSCoR state and solidifies UNLV?s position in NoC architecture research.</AbstractNarration>
