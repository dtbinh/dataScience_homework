    <AbstractNarration>The University of California, San Diego and San Diego State University propose the Computing Principles for All Students' Success (ComPASS) Project that will build local capacity for teaching the proposed new Advanced Placement CS Principles (CSP) course. ComPASS will create novel curricula and methodology content for teacher profession development. The project will develop and evaluate pedagogical content knowledge curriculum to support the adoption of best methods and practices in teaching CSP content. It will continue the engagement of the San Diego-area computing education community, and tailor its offered training and support to engage university faculty, as well as in-service and pre-service teachers both with and without computing backgrounds. It will build comprehensive, multi-pronged, flexible, and scalable infrastructure to train and support teachers and faculty and it will pilot that infrastructure at 2 universities, 5 community colleges, and 15 high schools. The project's research component will evaluate the use of blended-learning approaches in transferring effective pedagogical techniques to diverse instructor groups. In addition, the pilot sites have been chosen to reflect a commitment to serving underrepresented populations and the research plan includes a qualitative study of the attitudes of those students with respect to course content and their beliefs about computing. ComPASS will foster the implementation of broadbased, inclusive, and motivational education in computing foundations and computational thinking for all students, regardless of their eventual career path. The ComPASS project will directly impact 105 pre-service teachers, 19 in-service teachers, and about 5000 students. If successful, its model could be adopted at other universities, colleges, and school districts.</AbstractNarration>
