    <AbstractNarration>1118181&lt;br/&gt;Isaacs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this workshop on CO2 Utilization is to foster discussion and innovation across the disciplines involved in the development of practicable methods and technologies for CO2 Utilization. This group of stakeholders includes scientific researchers, policy makers, venture capitalists, and industry executives working in this area. The workshop will provide an environment for open dialogue about the challenges facing widespread adoption of various CO2 Utilization techniques. By linking across disciplines, innovative solutions can be developed that should have a broad impact in driving the inventive and novel solutions needed in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The report that comes out of this workshop promises to provide a reference for both attendees and outside observers to gain insight into the discussions that take place during the workshop. The report will summarize the lectures given and also include the interdisciplinary discussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF award is to fund travel grants for travel, housing and conference expenses for several graduate and post-doctoral students and junior faculty. Additional funding to cover other workshop expenses is in hand.</AbstractNarration>
