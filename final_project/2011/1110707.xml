    <AbstractNarration>Although most living insects are capable of flight, their aerial abilities vary widely from group to group. Owlflies (Neuroptera: Ascalaphidae) are one of the few groups of insects that exhibit a highly specialized "aerial syndrome", characterized by the ability to mate, capture prey, and consume prey, all while on the wing. The factors involved in the origin and evolution of this distinctive behavioral syndrome have never been examined in detail. This project will investigate -- through new taxonomic and phylogenetic work -- the development of the syndrome in owlflies and its influence on their evolutionary history. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will provide additional insights into the repeated emergence of novel life history strategies that occur in animals through the convergence of advanced anatomical and behavioral adaptations -- an area of considerable conceptual interest, as the development of these new strategies may be a prerequisite for the broader radiation of particular lineages into previously unoccupied niches. Support from this award will enhance dissertation research in neuropteran systematics by enabling new collaborations and by supporting fieldwork and research collection visits. The work will also contribute to the development and extension of new tools for aggregating and disseminating global information on neuropterid insects through its collaborations with the web-based Lacewing Digital Library project.</AbstractNarration>
