    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to develop a truncated prediction approach to control design for time-delay systems with or without magnitude/energy constraints in the control input. In comparison with the classical prediction based approaches, this proposed approach will result in controllers that do not contain distributed terms and will thus entirely avoid the implementation problems associated with the traditional prediction based approaches. It will also provide a powerful tool for the control of constrained time-delay systems which is seldom considered in the literature. Deliverables include a set of powerful tools for various aspects of the analysis and control such systems, including the problems of disturbance rejection and output regulation. An important part of the project is to apply the obtained theoretical results on high speed rotors suspended by active magnetic bearings (AMBs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design methods developed in this project will help engineers to handle practical systems more effectively. The applications of these methods to the control of a high speed rotor/AMB test rig will enhance our ability to operate compressors in the oil and gas industries more effectively and in deeper seas. Therefore, the successful completion of this project will contribute in a way to alleviate one the most pressing issues our society faces today: the energy crisis. The research will require the involvement of graduate students and undergraduate students, possibly minority and female students, and thus will leverage the funding that NSF can provide for basic research activities to assist in education. The results obtained in this research will be prepared into conference and journal papers for dissemination.</AbstractNarration>
