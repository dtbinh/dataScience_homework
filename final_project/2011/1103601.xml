    <AbstractNarration>1103601 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports a cooperative research project by Dr. Mahmoud Reda Taha, University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and Usama F. Kandil, Egyptian Petroleum Research Institute, Cairo. They plan to study Nano-rubber Toughened Epoxy for Energy Absorbing Composites. The research aims at introducing a new generation of multi-scale fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites with enhanced energy absorption. We suggest altering the microstructure of the polymer matrix used in making FRP composites using functionalized nanoparticles. The proposed microstructural change will convert the polymer matrix to a new nanocomposite that when used with reinforcing fibers will produce a multi-scale FRP composite with enhanced energy absorption. The new multi-scale FRP will enable expanding the use of FRP in applications typically governed by the limited toughness/energy absorption and fracture toughness of current FRP composites when subjected to high strain rate loading. This research builds on the experience the UNM team gained during a six-month visit by Dr. Kandil in 2010, during which they acquired all equipment necessary to synthesize functionalized polyolefin rubber nanoparticles and successfully produced new nanocomposites. This new work is focused on synthesis, fabrication and testing of the nanocomposite and the new FRP composite at a variety of length scales and under different hygrothermal conditions. The work is multidisciplinary in nature requiring the expertise of the two PIs from Egypt and the US on polymer chemistry, polymer characterization, composite fabrication and testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: The research aims at enhancing the energy absorption of the polymer resin used to produce FRP composites using a balanced mix of functional polyolefin rubber (EP) nanoparticles and&lt;br/&gt;montmorillonite (o-mmt) nanoparticles. This new toughened nanocomposite will be used to produce a&lt;br/&gt;new generation of FRP composites with enhanced energy absorption. While the use of hard and soft&lt;br/&gt;nanoparticles in producing toughened polymer nanocomposites is not new and has been reported in the&lt;br/&gt;literature, functionalization of these nanoparticles and using this toughened polymer nanocomposite to&lt;br/&gt;produce multi-scale FRP is new and can lead to significant enhancement in the energy absorption and&lt;br/&gt;fracture toughness of FRP composites. The research will contribute to further our understanding on the role of a modified polymer matrix plays in changing the energy absorption and fracture toughness of FRP composites.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project will help enrich the research environment at UNM by attracting minority (Hispanic and Native American) undergraduate students to Civil Engineering research in the field of structural composites. The US-PI plans efforts to attract US citizen students from underrepresented groups including Women, Hispanics and Native Americans to work on this project. In Fall 2010, the US-PI started a collaborative effort with UNM Valencia campus where more than 50% of students are minority students. This new collaboration extends an invitation to the US-PI and two of his graduate students to visit the Valencia campus once each semester and give presentations on engineering research to attract top undergraduate students to conduct research at the UNM School of Engineering. Two undergraduate students nominated by UNM Valencia campus will join the PI's laboratory. It is planned that one of these two students from the Valencia campus will be funded by this grant toward his/her Master?s degree starting in Fall 2011. Furthermore, the proposed research will have a significant impact on the research and academic environments at EPRI (Egypt). EPRI houses 15 research and service centers and is the home of 312 researchers. The US-PI will participate in an annual short course to be held at EPRI in Summer 2012 and Summer 2013. This short course will be focused on multiscale mechanical characterization of polymer composites. This short course will provide an excellent opportunity for both PIs to interact with young researchers at EPRI. Finally, one graduate student at EPRI working on this project will visit UNM and join the US-PI laboratory for six month receiving training on FRP composite fabrication and testing as well as on nanoindentation of polymer nanocomposites. &lt;br/&gt;This proposal is supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program where NSF supports the US side and the Government of Egypt funds the Egyptian side.</AbstractNarration>
