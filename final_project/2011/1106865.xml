    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1106865&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Dev Sinha, Ralph Cohen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal organizers will be program organizers for a&lt;br/&gt;one-week summer school program in algebraic topology, to be&lt;br/&gt;hosted at the University of Oregon. This summer school will bring&lt;br/&gt;thirty graduate students and early-career mathematicians together&lt;br/&gt;for an introduction to an area in topology which is ripe for&lt;br/&gt;investigation, and whose techniques will inform and inspire&lt;br/&gt;developments throughout topology. This summer school will use a&lt;br/&gt;unique blend of pedagogical tools, combining elements which have&lt;br/&gt;been successful in other settings. Younger researchers will be&lt;br/&gt;involved with both organizing and giving talks. Attendees will be&lt;br/&gt;encouraged to work problems, fill in background, and do reading&lt;br/&gt;together in addition to attending lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The West Coast Topology Summer School continues a series that&lt;br/&gt;began in summer 2010 and will strengthen the knowledge base of&lt;br/&gt;topologists and others who use topology and build a cohort of&lt;br/&gt;junior researchers familiar with recent developments in the&lt;br/&gt;subject. The program organizers of the Summer School are the&lt;br/&gt;principal investigators, together with Alejandro Adem of the&lt;br/&gt;University of British Columbia and the Pacific Institute of&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences (PIMS). PIMS is a partner in the project,&lt;br/&gt;which will bring together US--based graduate students, largely&lt;br/&gt;from the western United States, and Canadian graduate students&lt;br/&gt;sponsored by PIMS. In its role as a basic study of shape,&lt;br/&gt;topology has significant ramifications in other areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, from basic counting problems (combinatorics) to&lt;br/&gt;solutions of equations (algebra) to applications and extensions&lt;br/&gt;of the calculus (analysis). More broadly, knowledge of topology&lt;br/&gt;is essential for example in studying the structure of the early&lt;br/&gt;universe, in designing a robot arm with a minimal number of&lt;br/&gt;controllers, and in searching large data sets for meaningful&lt;br/&gt;groupings as successfully done recently for study of breast&lt;br/&gt;cancer. This summer school will strengthen the ties between basic&lt;br/&gt;areas of theoretical mathematics. Mathematicians from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented backgrounds will be vigorously recruited.&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students and post-docs will gain hands-on experience&lt;br/&gt;with some of the most important developments of contemporary&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, preparing them to be future leaders of the field.&lt;br/&gt;Participants will enlarge their professional networks, which is&lt;br/&gt;especially critical given the geographical distances faced by&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians in the western half of North America. Organizers&lt;br/&gt;and participants will also have the opportunity to reflect upon&lt;br/&gt;the array of pedagogical tools employed, and might employ some&lt;br/&gt;themselves in training graduate students and undergraduates or&lt;br/&gt;reaching out to fellow scientists and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
