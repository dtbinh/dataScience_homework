    <AbstractNarration>The TiPi: Engineering and Engineering Transfer Pipeline Project is using scholarship support to recruit, retain and graduate 75 Engineering and Engineering Technology students. The financially needed, talented scholarship awardees will transfer from two-year schools into the third year at Rochester Institute of Technology. The students will be enrolled full-time in the Engineering and Engineering Technology Bachelor degree programs. The scholarship funds are supplemented by institutional financial aid intended to ensure the scholars graduate on time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholar program builds on a well-established infrastructure of student support and intervention. The scholar support mechanisms identify scholars in academic jeopardy and proactively intervene on their behalf. The project's proactive student support programs could become a national model for assisting similar transfers into private institutions. The project uses co-op experiences designed to increase the probability of career success thereby impacting the scholars for a lifetime. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Periodic program assessment includes quantitative data such as grade point average and co-op salaries and qualitative data from surveys of scholars, faculty and employers.</AbstractNarration>
