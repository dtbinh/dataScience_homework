    <AbstractNarration>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the Missouri Botanical Garden that will provide research training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2012- 2014. The program focuses on the three basic areas of plant systematics, conservation biology, and ethnobotany. The Garden has a pool of about 20 resident researchers who will serve as mentors. There is a wide range of very interesting and exciting projects for the students, including taxonomic description of new species from the tropics, DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, DNA barcoding, pollen analysis, pollination biology of rare species, seed morphology and anatomy, conservation biology of threatened species, ecology of invasive species, herbarium study of historically important collections, Native American ethnobotany, and revisionary studies of economically important plants. Students are expected to do full-time research as well as participate in biweekly lunch-time seminars and workshops, including subjects on botany and conservation, and also professional enrichment activities such as responsible conduct and ethics in research, writing and communication skills, career opportunities in botany and academia, and the graduate school application process. Students are also provided tours of local natural and cultural attractions. In addition to the research mentor, REU students have access to a herbarium of 6.2 million specimens, an excellent botanical library, rich garden collections, a 2,400 acre natural area, and a laboratory with facilities for plant anatomy, microscopy, digital imaging, SEM, and DNA analysis. The program?s multi-phase recruitment effort consists of a program website and flyers, personal contact with local and regional universities, and advertisement on digital newsletters and organization websites. Students are selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research in botany, conservation, and ethnobotany. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including use of an REU common assessment tool.
