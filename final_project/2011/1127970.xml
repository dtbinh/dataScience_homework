    <AbstractNarration>This workshop enables collaboration between Innovation and Organizational Sciences scholars and regional electricity planning managers in the Northwest US and Canada. Transmission planning is characterized by multiple processes and organizations with overlapping and diffuse authority, as well as competing interests and policy direction from different levels of government. The diffuse authority in these systems presents an opportunity for the scholarly community and a challenge to electric grid modernization and expansion. As part of the project, IOS scholars will develop research papers and present and discuss them with regional transmission planners and stakeholders from private industry and non-governmental organizations. The collaborators aim to identify practical lessons based on organizational theories to improve the overall effectiveness of regional transmission planning. In addition, they will identify basic organizational sciences research agendas that may be most relevant to regional planning organizations, providing a foundation for future research in the field. A workshop report detailing both the evidence-based practice lessons and the promising agendas for future research will be made widely available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, this research will contribute to economic and environmental improvement through improved planning processes and strategies. Effective planning is an essential component to upgrade the electric grid and realize smart grid benefits, bring more renewable-sourced electricity generation online, and ensure the grid's stability.</AbstractNarration>
