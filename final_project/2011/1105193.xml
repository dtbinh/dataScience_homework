    <AbstractNarration>Three rather ambitious projects are proposed in the area of geometric&lt;br/&gt;group theory. The first is inspired by Zlil Sela's geometric solution&lt;br/&gt;of Tarski's logic problem. The PI and Mladen Bestvina plan to complete&lt;br/&gt;their program to solve by geometric means two forty-year-old problems&lt;br/&gt;of Mal'cev. They also propose to generalize their methods and provide&lt;br/&gt;an alternate proof to the Tarski problem. The second project, joint&lt;br/&gt;with Michael Handel, is to solve the conjugacy problem for the outer&lt;br/&gt;automorphism group Out(F) of a free group F. Much of the research in&lt;br/&gt;this area is driven by the similarities between linear groups, surface&lt;br/&gt;mapping class groups, and Out(F). The conjugacy problem has been&lt;br/&gt;solved for these other two classes. The final project, again joint&lt;br/&gt;with Mladen Bestvina, is to better understand the geometry of outer&lt;br/&gt;automorphism groups of free groups. In particular, it is proposed to show&lt;br/&gt;that a complex analogous to the curve complex in the mapping class&lt;br/&gt;group setting is word hyperbolic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three projects are proposed in the area of geometric group&lt;br/&gt;theory. Geometric group theory is a relatively young branch of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics in which problems from other areas of mathematics are&lt;br/&gt;reformulated and then solved in geometric terms. This approach has&lt;br/&gt;been successful in areas that are sometimes viewed as distant from&lt;br/&gt;geometry. For example, Zlil Sela used geometric methods to solve an&lt;br/&gt;old logic problem of Tarski. Inspired by Sela's methods, the PI and&lt;br/&gt;Mladen Bestvina propose to solve two old logic problems of&lt;br/&gt;Mal'cev. Group theory is another area where these methods have been&lt;br/&gt;particularly successful. Groups are ubiquitous in math and the&lt;br/&gt;sciences. The set of symmetries of a molecule is an example. There is&lt;br/&gt;an important class of groups called "free groups" from which all other&lt;br/&gt;groups can be constructed. The set of symmetries of a free group F is&lt;br/&gt;another important group, denoted Out(F), which has been the subject of&lt;br/&gt;much current interest. The PI proposes two other projects focusing on&lt;br/&gt;Out(F). In one, he and Michael Handel propose to solve an old and&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problem on Out(F), namely that its conjugacy problem is&lt;br/&gt;solvable. In the other project, the PI and Bestvina propose to better&lt;br/&gt;understand the intrinsic geometry of Out(F).</AbstractNarration>
