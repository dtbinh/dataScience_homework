    <AbstractNarration>Weak gravitational lensing - the subtle distortion of the images of background galaxies caused by the bending of light by intervening mass - is one of the most potentially powerful probes of dark energy. But measurement and interpretation of the lensing signal is complicated by intrinsic correlations between the alignments of galaxy images. Intrinsic correlations can arise when physically close galaxies are aligned by the gravitational field of the matter surrounding them, or when a matter structure links the orientation of a galaxy close to it to the lensed image of a galaxy far behind. Previous studies have shown that if intrinsic alignments are ignored, the lensing constraints on the dark energy equation of state are biased by up to 50%. This project will study the 3-point intrinsic correlations of alignments and how their effects can be removed from the lensing signal. The Principal Investigator, collaborator, and graduate student supported by the project will carry out analytical calculations and numerical integrations to develop the method of "self-calibration," which uses additional correlations that can all be extracted from the same lensing survey to calculate the intrinsic alignment contamination and remove it. They will derive statistical estimators of the 3-point correlations and study their dependencies on redshift, luminosity, color, and morphology in order to understand their scaling properties. The work will have broad impact in cosmology, in developing an essential correction to lensing surveys. It will also contribute to graduate education and to the development research program at the Principal Investigator's institution. The Principal Investigator will also be involved in outreach to local amateur astronomy groups and through participation in public presentations and professional development programs for teachers.</AbstractNarration>
