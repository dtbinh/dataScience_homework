    <AbstractNarration>The XIX International Conference on Computational Methods in Water Resources will be held June 17-21, 2012, on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This biennial series of meetings has served as the premier venue for engineers, geoscientists, hydrologists, computer scientists and applied mathematicians to present and discuss their latest research. The increase in raw computational power, software developments, availability of on-line hydrologic data, and recent advances in cyber-infrastructure make this a particularly exciting time for computational applications to water resources and geoscience challenges. The conference will serve as a unique forum to bring together those from the computer science/applied math community who work in methods and tools with those from engineering, geoscience, government and industry who are responsible for addressing pressing water-related problems. Topics of pressing societal relevance being emphasized in special sessions include: climate change impacts on hydrology, river mechanics, circulation in coastal oceans, ecohydrology, contaminant transport in surface water and groundwater, and geological sequestration of carbon dioxide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF support will allow undergraduate and graduate students to register at a reduced rate, thereby facilitating participation by students. Students and post-docs will benefit from the opportunity to present their work at a major international conference. The conference will foster interactions among those from academia, government, and industry, and will also enhance international exchange. At the last meeting in the United States, approximately 40% of the participants were international, representing more than 20 countries. Students and other conference attendees will have the opportunity to interact with the distinguished plenary speakers, who represent a diverse international group that includes both senior and mid-career scholars. Students will submit full papers, thus providing another opportunity for student training. The conference proceedings will be openly available on the conference web site, thereby benefitting the entire scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
