    <AbstractNarration>This collaborative award provides support for participants in two applied mathematics meetings at Oklahoma State University and the University of Oklahoma during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 academic years, respectively:&lt;br/&gt;(1) a workshop on recent progress in partial differential equations of fluid mechanics, with emphasis on modeling of geophysical fluids, to be held at Oklahoma State University on November 12-13, 2011;&lt;br/&gt;(2) a workshop on applied mathematics, to be held at the University of Oklahoma in October, 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each meeting features invited lectures by leading researchers on topics of current research interest in applied partial differential equations and applied mathematics in general. The events bring together scholars currently making important contributions, early career mathematicians, and students working in the field. The conference encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://www.math.okstate.edu/ok_pde_workshop</AbstractNarration>
