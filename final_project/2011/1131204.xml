    <AbstractNarration>Doctoral Dissertation Research: Transnational Interlocks and Global Business&lt;br/&gt;SES - 1131204&lt;br/&gt;Michael Schwartz (PI)&lt;br/&gt;Josh Murray (co-PI)&lt;br/&gt;SUNY Stony Brook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Economic globalization raises questions about whether the emerging transnational business class acts in unison or whether this global business class is internally factionalized. In this context, interlocking directorates that connect transnational corporations play an important role. However, we know surprisingly little about the impact the growing number of such transnational interlocks has on national-level economic and political strategies. This study tests the relationship between transnational interlocks and actions taken by members of the global business community that aim to influence national governments, for instance by forming political action committees, making political donations, or placing former government officials on a firm's board of directors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This analysis combines data on such business strategies with information about corporate interlocking directorates in Fortune 500 companies for the years 2000-2010. First, panel regressions are used to test the hypothesis that firms with strong transnational interlocking directorates will be more likely to engage in globally and collectively oriented political behavior than firms that are not characterized by such interlocking directorates. Subsequent analyses focus on interlocks as a source of unity by using longitudinal random-effects regression models to test the related hypothesis that firms linked to each other through transnational interlocks will be more likely to exhibit similar political behavior than non-interlocked firms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project is timely, given the current public discourse about the intended and unintended long-term consequences of changing regulations regarding corporate spending and political action. This has also found its reflection in a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that lifts limits on corporate funding of political broadcasts (Citizens United vs. Federal Elections Commission, 558 U.S. 50, 2010). In addition, political analysts and the public have raised questions regarding the influence of foreign entities in U.S. elections. This study seeks to contribute to our understanding of the conditions under which the power of business in a globalized context has ramifications for the strategies of national governments.</AbstractNarration>
