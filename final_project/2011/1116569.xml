    <AbstractNarration>1116569&lt;br/&gt;Kirby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sixth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and associated Gordon-Kenan Research Seminar (GRS) on the Physics and Chemistry of Microfluidics will be held from June 25th through July 1st, 2011 at Waterville Valley Resort, Waterville Valley, NH. The meeting will involve participants from all research sectors, including academia, industry, and the federal government. This conference will offer a unique forum (and intimate professional setting) for the exchange of new ideas, presentation and discussion of unpublished results, speculative discussions, and opportunities for new interdisciplinary collaborations among attendees. The development of the GRS is an exciting enhancement that should greatly expand the impact of the conference on earlycareer researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRC on the Physics and Chemistry of Microfluidics provides a unique intellectual experience in which scientific researchers from many different disciplines come together in an intimate forum to discuss research and forge partnerships that are critical to the health and growth of our highly multidisciplinary field. The 2011 Gordon Research Conference will address topics that represent the latest advances in the field of microfluidics and nanofluidics over the past year. Topics that will be discussed in invited oral and poster sessions include micro- and nanoseparations, bioanalytical devices, low-Reynolds-number fluid mechanics, and nanoparticles and colloids. Young scientists, including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and young faculty, are invited to present their latest work during several poster sessions at the conference, and the GRS has been implemented this year to provide a two-day conference for early-career attendees only. The Gordon Research Conferences provide facilities and support that allow for the highest level of interaction among all participants. New funding is being requested from the National Science Foundation for this meeting. It is anticipated that with the financial support of NSF, the sixth conference in this series will be unparalleled in transforming our community?s scientific understanding and application of micro- and nanofluidic technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts that result from the 2011 Gordon Research Conference on the Physics and Chemistry of Microfluidics include but are not limited to: (1) providing an unparalleled opportunity (both in the Gordon Research Conference and in the Gordon-Kenan Research Seminar) for early-career researchers to interact closely with more established scientific researchers to broaden their scientific education and to promote their future careers as scientific researchers; (2) fostering and promoting long-term relationships between researchers in diverse fields including bioengineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemistry, and physics; and (3) promoting the development of multidisciplinary teams that can address difficult problems in biological, chemical, and physical sciences by use of micro- and nanotechnologies</AbstractNarration>
