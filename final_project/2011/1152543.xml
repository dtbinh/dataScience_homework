    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Alan Heyduk of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine will develop the early transition metal chemistry of redox-active, pincer ligands. Redox-active ligands provide a method for facilitating multi-electron reactivity at metal centers that are traditionally incapable of redox reactivity. Professor Heyduk's research effort will focus on understanding the impact of metal choice and ligand substituent on both the redox properties of these novel ligands as well as the capacity for small molecule activation at the metal center. Systematic synthesis of ligand derivatives will be complemented by detailed spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational studies to developing a deeper understanding of the electronic interactions between redox-active ligands and coordinated metal ions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work could lead to new homogeneous catalysts for small molecule reactions such as water oxidation, hydrogen production and C-H bond functionalization. Success in the former two areas could impact energy storage strategies for alternative energy solutions such as solar and wind. Success in C-H bond functionalization would have an impact on any area of chemical synthesis in which it is desirable to utilize low-cost, readily abundant chemical feedstock in an atom-economical way. The proposed work will also provide training in both fundamental chemical sciences and in next-generation alternative energy chemistry to the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>
