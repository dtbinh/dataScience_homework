    <AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop an accurate and computationally efficient technique in order to locate and identify faults in power systems using synchronized measurements. The approach is to capture the arrival times of the fault-initiated traveling waves using a few synchronized sensors and triangulating the location of the fault based on the recorded arrival times of these waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal is the utilization of synchronized voltage samples recorded by sparsely placed sensors in order to accurately determine the location of faults in power systems. Current utilization of these sensors is confined to synchronized phasors. This project will utilize for the first time the point-on-wave samples which are synchronized throughout the entire power system. This will be transformative leading to new applications that can exploit information related to traveling waves on power lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will expand the application areas for synchronized measurements which are&lt;br/&gt;rapidly being deployed in increasing numbers in smart grids. This will have an impact on the new investments on system protection and quality of service for all major utilities in the country. Two graduate students will be trained in the area of electric grids, crucial&lt;br/&gt;to designing nation's future energy system. Furthermore, project's results will be incorporated into the curriculum through lab exercises. Also, students from underrepresented groups will be targeted through the university's STEMteams, NUPrime (multi-cultural engineering) and WIE (women in engineering) programs and supported by REU supplements.</AbstractNarration>
