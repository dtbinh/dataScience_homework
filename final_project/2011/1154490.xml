    <AbstractNarration>Lawrence Technological University (LTU) is enabling students to complete a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering with a concentration in power engineering, and well positioned to be employed by the U.S. nuclear power industry. Students complete an associate's program at Monroe County Community College (MCCC) in Nuclear Engineering Technology and then transfer to LTU to complete the BS degree. Two pre-engineering scholarships are awarded to students at MCCC each year of the five-year award, and eighteen to LTU students in the electrical or computer engineering programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is preparing highly-adaptable energy technicians skilled in the generation, transmission, and distribution of power, while simultaneously laying the foundation for continuing education and training necessary to upgrade workforce personnel skills. To ensure student success, LTU is offering a comprehensive package of student outreach and support, career exploration, and job placement services. Scholarship recipients are learning about power engineering through interdisciplinary courses, guest lecturers, and field trips, as well as participation in a local chapter of professional organizations. LTU is leveraging its network of local and regional industry partnerships, including DTE Energy Corporation, to aid in the recruitment, retention, and job placement of the S-STEM scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is meeting national needs for a highly-skilled, diversified workforce in the generation, transmission, and distribution of power, and for highly-qualified candidates for graduate studies. The project is strengthening the partnership between the two-year and four-year institutions of higher education, along with local engineering and technology employers. As southeast Michigan is changing its economic base, the project will benefit a region with substantial challenges.</AbstractNarration>
