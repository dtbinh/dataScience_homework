    <AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will develop a systematic analytical solution to accurately design, build, and evaluate corrugated-core lignocellulosic sandwich panels for building envelope components as a potential solution for net zero energy construction. Components of a building envelope influence its structural and hygrothermal performance and determine a buildings consumption of operational energy; alternative designs and materials that reduce a building's operational energy will meet our nation's goal of market-ready, net-zero buildings. Model based on composite plate theory will account for bidirectional undulations of a corrugated-core in designing a lignocellulosic sandwich panel. The model will define the forming limits for designing the complex core of a sandwich panel. Project will also evaluate fullsize sandwich panel structural and hygrothermal performance for residential wall applications. The long-term educational goal of this CAREER project is to prepare new generation of engineers cognizant of sustainable building materials from lignocellulosic fibers and equipped with the knowledge to design and manufacture bio-based composite products for building envelopes in a net zero energy construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forty percent of US primary energy was consumed in the buildings sector, of which homes accounted for 54 percent and commercial buildings accounted for 46 percent. Residential buildings contribute 17 percent to the total US greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions measured in carbon dioxide equivalents, of which space heating and cooling account for 37 percent of GHG emissions. The US federal government has a goal of market-ready, net-zero energy commercial buildings by the year 2015 and residential buildings by 2030. The study proposes to advance the science of sustainable buildings through new design concepts using panelized systems for residential construction to meet structural and energy requirements of the building codes. Performance of multi-functional, lightweight, 3-D lignocellulosic panels will be superior to currently used materials as building envelope components and allow innovative panelized construction which will reduce the consumption of operational energy of our future homes and stimulate the home building industry. Considering an increased demand for green building materials (13 percent annual growth predicted in next five years), value-added products that complement commodity-based infrastructure will contribute to revitalizing segments of the forest products industry.</AbstractNarration>
