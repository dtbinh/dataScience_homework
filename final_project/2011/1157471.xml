    <AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Protein Folding Dynamics and the accompanying Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) on Protein Folding Dynamics will take place at the Ventura Beach Marriott, Ventura, California from January 7-8 (GRS)and January 8-13 (GRC). The main goal of the conference is to discuss Protein folding and the development of a framework to describe how proteins fold using the energy landscape perspective and concepts in polymer physics. The Graduate Research Seminar in Protein Folding Dynamics is organized as a satellite to the GRC in Protein Folding Dynamics. This workshop serves as a venue for graduate students and postdoctoral scientists to i) develop background on current techniques, theories and models in preparation for the GRC in Protein Folding Dynamics, ii) share their knowledge of protein folding methodologies and techniques and iii) meet each other and discuss their own research. The bulk of the workshop will be devoted to research presentation and posters. All sessions will be chaired by the students and post-docs enrolled at the GRS. The strong participation of young researchers will be of high value for the next generation of biophysicists. The conference is co-funded by the Division of Physics and by the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
