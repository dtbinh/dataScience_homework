    <AbstractNarration>I/UCRC for Identification Technology Research &lt;br/&gt;1160585 SUNY at Buffalo; Venugopal Govindaraju &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University at Buffalo, SUNY (UB) proposes to join the Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) as a university site. CITeR, currently comprised of Clarkson University (lead), West Virginia University and the University of Arizona, was established about a decade ago to be the forum for bringing industry and academic interests to converge in the biometrics arena.. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UB site proposes to advance the science of biometric technologies for both civilian and homeland security applications by integrating pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms with sensors technology. The UB team plans to fuse brain scans with facial expressions and recognition to attempt to record emotion. UB's interest is in encrypting biometric templates while maintaining efficiency of indexing and search. The multidisciplinary faculty at the UB site will design chemical and photo sensors to propose new biometric modalities with integrated liveness detection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UB site will further CITeR's objective to serve as a comprehensive academic center serving the growing identification technology research, undergraduate and graduate education, and outreach needs of the public and private sectors. The UB site brings an experienced team in the areas of behavioral science, computer vision, visualization, pattern recognition, machine learning, and pervasive computing. Under the auspices of BEAM (Buffalo Area Engineering Awareness for Minorities), the proposed site plans to attract the participation of local high school and undergraduate students. The UB site also intends to increase the number of under-represented minorities obtaining graduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. CITeR meetings are expected to serve as an excellent opportunity for students to interact with potential employers to understand challenges in the field.</AbstractNarration>
