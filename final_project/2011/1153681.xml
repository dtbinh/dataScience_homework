    <AbstractNarration>Methane gas hydrate is a unique ice-like mineral that occurs in large quantities on land in northern latitudes and in marine sediments. At room temperature, these minerals vaporize and release large quantities of methane which is a strong greenhouse gas. The vast quantities of these minerals which stand to become unstable and release methane to the atmosphere as Earth's surface and oceans warm is a serious concern. This award provides partial funding for the Second Gordon Research Conference on Natural Gas Hydrates in Ventura, California in March of 2012. This four and a half day conference brings experts from academia, industry, and the US National Lab system together with other participants including students and early career researchers. Topics of discussion will be: the physics and chemistry of gas hydrates, hydrate production, hydrates in the past and present environment, recent exciting discoveries, and what we know about hydrates on other planets. A focus of the conference will be on whether it is possible to produce hydrates in a sustainable manner. Broader impacts of the work include the importance of the theme to global warming and geohazards with regard to slope and ground stability in a warming world. An emphasis of the conference will be the engagement of students, postdocs, and early career faculty. Fellowships will be made available to help support the participation of members of groups historically under-represented in the sciences and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
