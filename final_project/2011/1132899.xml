    <AbstractNarration>Abstract Proposal: OISE-1132899 &lt;br/&gt;PI/Institution: Triantafyllou, Michael S., Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed U.S.-Brazil Ocean Engineering workshop (in Rio de Janeiro, August 16-18, 2011) will bring together US and Brazil experts to catalyze new collaborative areas between the two countries that will complement current ocean engineering effort s and strengthen the benefits for ocean related research in the US. The US delegation is led by Dr. Michael Triantafyllou (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and it has representation from the Naval Postgraduate School, the U. of Michigan, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Texas A&amp;M University, Stevens Institute of Technology, and Florida Atlantic University. The Brazilian counterparts, led by Dr. Murilo Augusto Vaz (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro), are from the Universidade de Sao Paulo, Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Rio de Janeiro, Universidade Estatal de Campinas, Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnologicas, Centro de Pesquisas e Desenvolvimento Leopoldo Am√©rico Miguez de Mello, and Petrobras. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brazil has made significant investments in R&amp;D for off-shore oil and gas drilling and thus developed considerable expertise in ocean resource extraction. Brazil has also invested heavily in new facilities, research institutes, and university programs in ocean engineering making it a world leader in deep water oil and gas reservoirs exploration. Brazil's investment coincides with similar efforts at US universities increasing ocean research and related education activities thus making this workshop a very timely and productive endeavor.</AbstractNarration>
