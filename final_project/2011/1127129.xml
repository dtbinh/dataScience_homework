    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of the conference is to bring together physicists and mathematicians working in related areas of differential geometry, geometric analysis and theoretical physics. The main focus will be on special geometric structures and their applications in differential and algebraic geometry, theoretical physics and string theory. The conference is structured around invited talks, poster session and informal discussions.&lt;br/&gt;NSF funds will be used to support the participation of US researchers in the international conference on Geometric Structures in Mathematical Physics, Golden Sands, Bulgaria, September 19 - September 26, 2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics has always been a fundamental subject. The conference will provide an important opportunity for Americans researchers to meet their partners from around the world. The conference gives a unique opportunity for sharing of ideas between researchers of many EU and US scientists. Specific topics will be determined by the invited speakers who are all internationally recognized experts. These topics are all active and central areas of geometry and mathematical physics. The conference aims at presenting and developing further the latest achievements in the subject. About 70% of the requested total funding will be used for covering the traveling expenses of US participants without additional NSF support who are from under-represented groups, post-doctoral associates, and junior faculty.</AbstractNarration>
