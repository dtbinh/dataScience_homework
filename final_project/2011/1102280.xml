    <AbstractNarration>Droplet Thermotaxis: A New Platform Technology for Droplet-based Microfluidic Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is to develop a new platform technology for droplet-based microfluidic systems and demonstrate chemical unit operations using the developed platform for applications in chemistry and biology based on the study of the fundamental science of thermotaxis actuation. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is found at the cross-section of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and chemistry, laying the solid foundation and design guidelines for various microfluidic devices and systems that can take advantage of the newly discovered droplet actuation mechanisms. The proposed work will provide fundamental information for understanding the dual behavior of droplets, underlying science of unique transport mechanisms at the interfacial boundaries (liquid-liquid, liquid-air, liquid-solid), practical tool kits for droplet-based chemical experiments, methodology for optical diagnostics of miniaturized devices and systems, and novel experimental protocols for controlled chemical reactions.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are summarized as (a) wide applicability of our technology for handling liquid samples in a self-confined configuration and for the effective thermal management of droplets relevant to many disciplines (b) dissemination of cultivated knowledge to research communities across electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry and biology and (c) long-lasting educational outcomes from thoughtfully designed multidisciplinary mentorship and outreach activities involving undergraduate, graduate and K-12 students. &lt;br/&gt;This program is built upon a new and transformative discovery ? bidirectional droplet actuation based on the surface film deformation, unlike the traditional approach. This program will help understand the defining science and working principles so the newly proposed actuation mechanism may be favorably used for miniaturized devices and systems.</AbstractNarration>
