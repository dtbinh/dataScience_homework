    <AbstractNarration>This Scalable Nanomanufacturing (SBM) project aims to fundamentally modify nanotube synthesis and processing steps enabling the properties of nanotube superfiber to exceed those of existing fibers. Different forms of superfiber including yarn, braid, sheet, and fabric materials will be prepared. The approach to form superfiber is by synthesizing carbon nanotube arrays or forests of nanotubes, post-treating the arrays, and spinning the arrays into fibers. Technical advancements will be achieved in this project based on experimental, analytical and computational approaches that enable scale-up of the extraordinary properties of short nanotubes to bulk fibrous materials. The major technical roadblock to scale-up is that defects occur during manufacturing of long nanotube arrays. To remove this barrier, new methods and approaches of substrate engineering, base flow synthesis, thermal healing of defects, micro-spinning, and coating will be combined to improve the quality of nanotubes. The expected outcome is to design carbon nanotube superfiber materials with breakthrough properties, and to scale up superfiber manufacturing for commercialization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project will be to allow industries to replace their incumbent materials with superfiber materials that are lighter, tougher, stronger, and carry more electrical current. This project will provide the technical horsepower needed to close the gap between the properties of short research-grade nanotubes and commercial nanotube bulk materials, thus enabling American industry to manufacture a new fiber material which will revolutionize the engineering designs of dozens of products. The research will provide a better understanding why nanotubes have defects, why nanotubes stop growing, why fiber does not achieve the strength of nanotubes, and how to overcome these barriers. This project will also design new spinning and post processing approaches for long nanotubes that allow manufacturing scale-up and commercialization. An academic-corporate collaboration will help to transition the new technology into applications. Education and outreach activity in the project will focus on teaching students including underrepresented and high school students about nanotechnology and product innovation. An international Nanotechnology Materials Workshop will be held each year and include student presenters. Research results will be disseminated through editing a book on nanotube superfiber, journal and conference publications, and a web site. Results from the project will be integrated into classroom teaching.</AbstractNarration>
