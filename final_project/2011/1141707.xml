    <AbstractNarration>This project is to support the travel and accommodation support for 13 Alaska Native participants (two of which are FAI board members) and two facilitators to attend a Think Tank workshop titled "Strengthening the Sustainability of Alaska Native Communities in a Post Oil Economy." This workshop is anticipated as phase one of a larger three phase project, facilitated by the First Alaskans Institute, an Alaska Native serving institution, to bring community members, Alaska Native Scholars, and the scientific community together to strategize on a plan for researching and synthesizing existing data to get a complete picture of the economic and social impacts of declining oil revenues and the changes a post oil economy will have on the Alaska Natives and rural communities. The final phase envisioned but not funded by this proposal request would be the creation of complex economic and social models for the future long-term sustainability of Alaska Native and rural communities in Alaska.</AbstractNarration>
