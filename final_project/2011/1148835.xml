    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the U.S. National Academy of Sciences to carry out its responsibilities as the adhering body for the United States to DIVERSITAS, an international program of biodiversity science. The Board on International Organizations (BISO) of the National Research Council (NRC) executes these responsibilities through the U.S. National Committee for DIVERSITAS (USNC). The overarching goal of the USNC is to contribute constructively to the two DIVERSITAS goals: 1) understanding biodiversity and its importance, and 2) managing biodiversity and ecosystem services in a sustainable way. DIVERSITAS will establish a US National Committee of academics, government scientists, NGOs and policy makers to will contribute to the science-policy interface related to biodiversity and ecosystem services issues and emerging international assessments. Through national committee meetings and participation in national professional society meetings and international meetings, DIVERSITAS will be a liaison, bringing together the disparate elements of the broad U.S. community of academics, government scientists, NGOs and policy makers concerned with issues related to biodiversity and ecosystem services, and linking them with their counterparts around the world through the DIVERSITAS networks. Funds will provide support for the National Committee, organizational support for DIVERSITAS, and travel to national and international meetings.</AbstractNarration>
