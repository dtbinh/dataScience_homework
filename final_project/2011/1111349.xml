    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: 8th The International Workshop on Piezoelectric Materials and Applications&lt;br/&gt;(IWPMA) 2011 meeting is scheduled to be held from August 7 - 11, 2011, in Roanoke, Virginia. This&lt;br/&gt;meeting will be held in conjunction with 6th Annual Energy Harvesting Workshop, and 3rd Annual&lt;br/&gt;Center for Intelligent Material System and Structures (CIMSS) Conference. The focus of the meeting is on energy. The workshop will provide in-depth information on the application of smart materials with a focus on energy related issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The support from NSF will be mostly used for (i) enhancing student participation&lt;br/&gt;targeting underrepresented minority participants, women, and high school teachers and students, (ii)&lt;br/&gt;registration and travel support for lecturers providing tutorial and plenary speakers, and (iii) registration&lt;br/&gt;fees for returning veterans to enhance their educational experience. The participation of small business&lt;br/&gt;companies at this meeting will be supported through NSF I/UCRC: Center for Energy Harvesting&lt;br/&gt;Materials and Systems (CEHMS). The meeting will serve as both a recruiting tool and as graduate&lt;br/&gt;leadership training. The tutorials provided at the meeting will have strong emphasis on the involvement of&lt;br/&gt;high school African-American students in higher research and education in Blacksburg, Virginia.</AbstractNarration>
