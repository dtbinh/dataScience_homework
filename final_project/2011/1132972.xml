    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a planning visit to Bari, Italy to establish a collaborative research project on the processes controlling slow moving landslides. The US researchers will work with counterpart at the University of Bari and the Italian National Research Council (CNR). The international research team brings together geotechnical and geological scientists with both applied and theoretical knowledge in the processes controlling landscape change in mountainous regions. This catalytic research activity is designed to share preliminary knowledge and data between the US and Italian researchers and to commence initial field activity. The study will focus on two hilltop towns in the Appenine Mountains of Southeastern Italy. These towns are nearly encircled by landslides that are slowly undermining the towns and destroying infrastructure. In order to prevent infrastructure damage imparted by landslides, the variables that enhance and inhibit landslide movement must be identified and quantified.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this research will contribute to better management of landscapes prone to slow landsliding events. A planned outcome of this project is competitive proposals for ongoing international research collaborations between the participants. In addition, the project will enable a graduate student at Tulane University to conduct extensive field work in Italy, use unique Italian facilities, and develop an international network of collaborators at an early stage in her academic career.</AbstractNarration>
