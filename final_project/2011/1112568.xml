    <AbstractNarration>Gregory Beran of the University of California at Riverside is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to develop a computational method that enables the efficient and reliable prediction of molecular crystal structures and properties. The model will combine a quantum mechanical treatment of individual molecules and their dominant interactions with a classical treatment, while weaker interactions are being approximated using a computationally inexpensive classical polarizable force field. This project has three principle objectives: to develop the model into a practical computational tool, to benchmark the performance of the model on a set of well-studied molecular crystals, and to apply this model to several challenging crystal structure prediction problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help make it possible to predict, before any experiments are performed, how molecules pack together in solid-state crystals. Crystal packing affects useful properties such as the solubility of pharmaceuticals in the body, the charge-carrier performance of organic semi-conductor materials, the detonation of energetic materials, and efficiency of solid-state chemical reactions. The research will provide new insights into the physical interactions that govern crystal packing and into how these can be controlled to design new high-performance molecular materials.</AbstractNarration>
