    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will support a workshop to create peer networks among pre-tenure faculty who are pursuing careers in engineering education research. Because many faculty who do research in engineering education are hired in departments where all or most of the faculty pursue discipline-specific engineering research, previous research has shown these faculty face several challenges in long-term career success. The peer and mentoring relationships that will be established by this workshop are anticipated to provide guidance on how to increase the success of faculty and thus retain them in engineering education research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to build peer mentoring networks among faculty engaged in engineering education research. By sharing success strategies, these networks can lead to greater success of engineering faculty members, particularly those at institutions without established engineering education programs or faculty and administrative expertise in engineering education. The PIs have addressed how the network established by this workshop can be sustained following termination of NSF funding.</AbstractNarration>
