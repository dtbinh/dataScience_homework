    <AbstractNarration>1124569&lt;br/&gt;Griffiths&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place February, 2012 at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral in Santa FÃ©, Argentina. Organized by Dr. D. Vaughan Griffiths, Dr. Graham Mustoe, and Dr. Anthony Petrella, all from the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) in Golden, Colorado, the institute will focus on advanced numerical tools and their applications to bioengineering. Topics will include finite elements, boundary and discrete element methodologies, constitutive modeling of composite materials, prosthesis modeling, probabilistic methods, and concepts and applications of medical imaging. Two field trips will be organized to a local hospital and to a bioengineering manufacturing company, enabling participants to obtain first-hand exposure to practical and medical issues in bioengineering. To encourage the use of numerical methods, students will be provided with finite, boundary, and discrete element software, which will allow them to apply the theoretical knowledge acquired during the course. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PASI aims to generate future long-term collaboration between participants from the US and Latin America, which will span both academia and industry, including publications, joint presentations and sessions at international scientific congresses in bioengineering. The organizers are planning on attracting a diverse selection of student participants to the PASI through their ties to regional universities with a high proportion of underrepresented graduate students in engineering fields. A web site to be developed will be used to publicize the course, define recruitment criteria, and also for disseminating information and handouts relating to the PASI. After the activity is over, the site will become a resource for participants to keep in contact, and learn of future events, conferences and workshops related to the dual themes of numerical methods and bioengineering.</AbstractNarration>
