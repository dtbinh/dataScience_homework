    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year continuing award for a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site Program at Polytechnic University of New York, entitled, RET Site: Science and Mechatronics Aided Research for Teachers with an Entrepreneurship expeRience (SMARTER) Program, under the direction of Dr. Vikram Kapila. This is a renewal of a successful 3 year RET Site program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SMARTER program will provide a professional development opportunity to a total of 36 middle and high school in-service teachers (12 per year for three years) in the areas of science, technology, engineering, mathematics and entrepreneurship from the New York City Public Schools. During each year of the project, under the guidance of Dr. Kapila and six senior personnel, 12 teachers will receive mentoring and conduct inquiry-based, hands-on, engineering research in the exciting field of mechatronics through six-week long summer workshops. Collaborative activities involving Technology Management faculty and the Centers for Entrepreneurship and Technology will enable teachers to learn about entrepreneurship, conduct innovation case-studies, and shadow entrepreneurs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will benefit the teachers by reinforcing their science and math skills; enriching their STEM experience through exposure to real-world engineering research; developing and honing their research skills; cultivating and sustaining creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship traits; and providing opportunities to network with tech-entrepreneurs. Moreover, the teachers' schools will benefit since the participants will be able to provide their students with a solid foundation for college-level study in STEM; integrate hands-on activities with content and performance standards in curriculum; and mentor students to participate in an Inno/Vention student idea competition. A business-philanthropy partnership will allow teachers' students to gain real-world entrepreneurial experience through summer internships at start-up technology businesses. The project will serve as a catalyst to induce a cultural change that will transform students from being mere consumers of technology to becoming creators of novel technological products.</AbstractNarration>
