    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is funding Professor Melikyan of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at California State University-Northridge to study the behavior of organic free radicals and cations being supported on a metal-organic species. Specifically, the PI will continue his work on propargyl systems in which the triple bond is "capped" by a cobalt hexacarbonyl group, to study how these "protected" propargylic systems can be manipulated for new bond constructions at the formal radical or cationic center. Among the major research objectives are the development of sequential alpha,alpha'-functionalization of polyunsaturated systems and the exploration of intramolecular radical cyclizations yielding topologically diverse carbo- and heterocyclic compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts involve training a cadre of undergraduate co-workers in modern organometallic synthesis methods, and broadening participation through the inclusion of members of groups historically underrepresented in the sciences. Plans are included to integrate the research results and methodology into the chemistry curriculum, and to widely disseminate research results via publication in main line sub-disciplinary journals.</AbstractNarration>
