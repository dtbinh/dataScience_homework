    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is the design, creation, evaluation, and dissemination of a customizable, non-digital card game for teaching computer security concepts to first- and second-year undergraduate students. The creation of the game is motivated by a need to heighten the understanding and awareness of computer security and privacy in an ever-increasing digital world, to act as a gateway to future education and careers in computer science, and to generally promote interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The project explores novel and creative ways to incorporate cyber-security games into existing curricula across a wide variety of disciplines, in particular, traditionally non-STEM and introductory courses. The project designs games with simple mechanics but that teach complex ideas and substantial security principles, which allow essential issues to be communicated to students of diverse backgrounds, especially those students typically under-represented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. In particular, the games are designed to engage students with low computer literacy, to dispel the myth that computer science is a solitary or isolating pursuit, and to be deployed at schools with little funding or support for IT resources. Games and course materials are disseminated though printed samples, a project web site, presentations at professional conferences, and at a local workshop the site will host. This project involves the participation of Hartnell Community College.</AbstractNarration>
