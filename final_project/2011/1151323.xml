    <AbstractNarration>This research examines the relations between perceived racial discrimination and romantic relationship functioning among African American couples. Very little research has examined the relations among perceived discrimination and romantic relationship functioning, and very little is known about how perceived discrimination affects interpersonal relationships or how romantic relationship interactions influence people's response to perceived discrimination. The proposed research seeks to fill this important gap in the literature by employing a prospective daily diary study to examine the unfolding context of African American couples' daily lives. These couples will complete a one-time background survey and a 3-week daily diary survey. Every day for 21 days, participants will log onto a secure website to access the daily diary portion of the study to record their daily experiences and feelings. Ultimately, the investigators will examine how feeling accepted or rejected by romantic partners influences the relation between perceived discrimination and intra-personal outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is consistent with NSF's goal to support research that has broader scientific impacts in a number of ways. It will fill an important gap in the psychological literature by examining African Americans' perceptions of racial discrimination, the impact it has on their romantic relationship functioning as well as how relationships can influence the negative consequences of perceived racial discrimination. Examining factors that moderate the harmful physiological responses to discrimination and the resulting negative health outcomes should help contribute to reducing existing health disparities facing African Americans. In addition, several ethnic minority graduate and undergraduate students are likely to be included in the conduct the research.</AbstractNarration>
