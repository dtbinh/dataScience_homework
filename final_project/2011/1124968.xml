    <AbstractNarration>This project is to provide partial financial support for up to 15 United States graduate students to present their work at the 15th International Congress on Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions (15th IC-MPMI), which will be held at Kyoto International Conference Center, Kyoto, Japan, on July 29-August 2, 2012. For the past 30 years, this meeting series has been the premier forum for announcing and presenting the most compelling scientific discoveries about the molecular events that mediate the interaction of plants and microbes. The meeting content includes both pathogenic and symbiotic associations and covers oomycete, fungal, bacterial, viral, and nematode pathogens; nitrogen-fixing and mycorrhizal symbioses; and even some unusual associations, such as parasitic plant-plant interactions. Awardees will be chosen by an ad hoc committee consisting of the Principal Investigator of the project and the United States members of the Board of Directors of the IS-MPMI based on the quality of the science reflected in the abstract, a statement regarding how attending this congress will impact the applicant's research and/or career, and the applicant's curriculum vitae. Ethnic and gender diversity and disabilities will be considered to achieve a broad and balanced awardee portfolio. Past meetings of this series have fostered intensive exchange of scientific information and collaborations across a broad range of research topics and geographic locations, and have provided opportunities for graduate students to present their work and to network with leading scientists. As such, this meeting series has played a major role in the buildup of fundamental knowledge in the area of plant-microbe interactions and in the training of the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>
