    <AbstractNarration>This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Development of the Nanoscale Engineering Concentration (NEC) at the University of Texas at Brownsville", under the direction of Dr. Karen Martirosyan, has as its objectives:1) To establish new nanotechnology courses for a structured NEC for undergraduate students in the College of Science, Mathematics, and Technology (CSMT) at UTB which is a minority serving institution with more than 92% of its students being Hispanic-American; 2) To upgrade existing coursework which includes nanoengineering laboratory training and establish online laboratory exercises by using the Clean Room Facility at the University of Houston; 3) To enable nanotechnology opportunities for NEC scholars within a framework of Senior Capstone Projects and Undergraduate Research; 4) To leverage NEC to enable professional development opportunities for graduate students at UTB. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NEC program is distinct from the standard nanotechnology minor programs now offered by several universities across the U.S. in that the proposed curriculum is designed as a fully integrated nanoengineering program across the Science, Mathematics, and Technology programs rather than a set of electives on nanotechnology related topics. The impact and associated outcomes of this program is in training students who will be prepared for the challenges of the emerging nanotechnology job sector.</AbstractNarration>
