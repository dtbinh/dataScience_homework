    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a reinforced composite material that combines the antimicrobial effectiveness of nanoscale silver with the strength and weight of reinforced composites to meet the antifouling performance specifications of the marine environment. In this project, Carbon Nanotube (CNT)-infused glass fiber composites will be used. CNT-infused glass fiber composites not only provide an excellent solution to the weight and strength requirements, but also provide an ideal support for nanoscale silver integration due to the strong van der Waals interaction between the nanosilver particles and CNT systems. Additionally, the conductive nature of the CNT-infused composites coupled with the readily available source of electric current offer a perfect opportunity to utilize electrochemical silver ion release to create a tunable antifouling effect. This project is expected to verify that effective antifouling capabilities can be inherently integrated into the composites used in products such as tidal turbines, thereby extending their life and lowering operating costs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide an anti-fouling reinforced composite material for ocean renewable energy and marine applications. Ocean renewable energy is emerging as a key element of the alternative energy solution. One of the general challenges is to produce key components of the system which are strong, lightweight and durable, but also antifouling. The availability of cost-effective antifouling solution is essential for the wide adoption of ocean renewable energy.</AbstractNarration>
