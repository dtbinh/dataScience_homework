    <AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for 12 United States researchers to attend an international meeting on ?Synergy with and Learning from Nature? to be held on October 20-22, 2011, in Istanbul, Turkey. The goal of the meeting is to bring together diverse research communities to identify research areas that will advance knowledge both in engineering and physical sciences as well as in life sciences. Specifically, the meeting will focus on the understanding and design of engineering systems that are in synergy with and learning from nature. The meeting is co-sponsored by the European Science Foundation (ESF), the Turkish Science and Technology Council (TUBITAK), the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), the National Science Council of Taiwan (NSC), and the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM). It will be attended by experts from all over the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key outcome of the meeting will be an international research agenda designed to help funding agencies to prioritize the investment of their research funds in the area of advanced sensors and sensor-based decision making and control. A secondary outcome of the meeting will be encouragement to women and minorities to become involved in this area of science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
