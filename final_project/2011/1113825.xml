    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop an Aromatic Thermosetting Copolyester (ATSP) system and process it into highly-effective wear resistant coatings. Surface treatments and coatings are key to improving wear performance and durability in a wide array of applications. In this project, different ATSP powder blends will be studied. Coatings of ATSP/PTFE blends on metal substrates (using sintering) will be produced. Tribological tests of these coatings under industrially-relevant conditions will be performed. Preliminary spray coatings from the ATSP powder blends will also be explored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide ultra-low wear coatings for mechanical devices, such as air-conditioning and refrigeration compressors, to replace the liquid lubricants. Recent preliminary research on air-conditioning and refrigeration compressor surfaces has shown that high-performance and recyclable ATSP system exhibit low friction coefficient and at least one order of magnitude reduction in wear rate compared to the state-of-art polymeric coatings. Blends of ATSP with other polymers and additives have the potential to offer low-cost and versatile wear resistant coatings for applications in engines, pumps and compressors.</AbstractNarration>
