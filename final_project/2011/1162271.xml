    <AbstractNarration>The investigators will examine the broad scientific rationale and develop detailed design requirements for a major new lidar/optical facility to study the chemistry and dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere from the middle stratosphere (~30 km) to well into the thermosphere (~1000 km). The objectives are to identify the key scientific problems currently challenging the middle and upper atmospheric sciences communities and determine what new observational capabilities, especially large aperture lidar systems, could facilitate significant progress in addressing those problems. It is envisioned that the centerpiece of the new lidar/optical facility would be a ~100 square meter collecting aperture that would consist of a 3-4 meter diameter fully steerable telescope in combination with a large array of smaller fix-pointed telescopes. In addition the facility would include important correlative instruments such as radars, imagers, spectrometers and perhaps in situ measurement capabilities using balloon and rocket probes. The specific project objectives are: 1. To determine the key scientific problems currently challenging the middle and upper atmosphere communities (with emphasis on those problems that could potentially benefit from the measurements achievable by a large aperture lidar/optical facility), 2. To determine what new observational capabilities could facilitate significant progress in addressing those problems, 3. To develop the top level design and operational requirements for the large optical telescope that would serve as the centerpiece of the new observatory, 4. To determine the design and operational requirements for the lidar systems that would utilize the large telescope, 5. To determine the key correlative instrumentation that would be essential to realize the full potential of the new observatory, and 6. To determine where the facility should be located to make the greatest contribution to science and to insure maximum operating productivity. The outstanding challenge in terrestrial upper atmosphere research is specifying the state of the space-atmosphere interaction region. There is growing recognition that meteorological sources of wave energy from the lower atmosphere are responsible for producing significant variability in the upper atmosphere. Furthermore, energetic particles and fields originating from the magnetosphere regularly alter the state of the ionosphere. These influences converge through close coupling between the ionosphere plasma and neutral thermosphere gas to produce emergent behavior in the space-atmosphere interaction region (SAIR). To fully explore neutral-ion coupling in the critical region above 100 km requires measurements of the neutral atmosphere to complement radar observations of the plasma. Lidar measurements of neutral thermospheric winds, temperatures and species can enable these explorations, an objective of highest priority for the upper atmosphere science community.</AbstractNarration>
