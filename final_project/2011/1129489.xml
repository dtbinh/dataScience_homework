    <AbstractNarration>This project sponsors a workshop to advance a research agenda in engineering epistemologies, one of the five areas identified in a 2005 NSF sponsored workshop on engineering education research that has received relatively little attention. The interdisciplinary conference will draw together thinkers from a variety of disciplines and educational systems to identify directions for future study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project lies in creating a robust research network that crosses disciplinary boundaries and connects members of historically different communities. The long-term results of the workshop and the research arising from it can have a potentially broad impact on how engineering is taught.</AbstractNarration>
