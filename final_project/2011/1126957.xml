    <AbstractNarration>In this project, the investigators will develop a set of computational tools to investigate long sequences of continuous data from physiological systems. One interesting property exhibited by these data sets is called "fractal scaling." This means that the data are "self-similar" on different time scales, so that short sections of data, when rescaled properly, resemble larger sections of data and this scaling holds true over a large range of time intervals. This is a defining feature of a fractal. Another fractal property is that the data exhibit fluctuations on many different time scales. Not all physiological data sets show this attribute. Some show instead a particular time scale at which the variability is most prominent. Many analytical and computational tools to study fractals have been developed over the last two decades. However, the large number of these tools makes it difficult for many investigators to make the proper choice when analyzing any given data set. Furthermore, different computational tools are susceptible to different types of artifacts and different tools are valid for different data types. Erroneous or misleading results can be obtained when the tools are improperly applied. It is very difficult for a non-expert in fractal mathematics to understand and keep track of all of these issues, which can inhibit progress in the investigation of many physiological and behavioral systems. In this project, the research team will assemble a set of established computational tools for fractal time-series analysis, apply them to a variety of data sets with known and unknown properties (i.e., artificially generated data and real physiological data), and determine when different tools break down, when they are most effective, how to detect when erroneous results are being generated, and how to interpret the results. This will provide increased confidence in the application of these tools and encourage their widespread use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fractal fluctuations are common in the behavior of biological systems. They have been found in heartbeat intervals, stride intervals, firing rates of neurons, human reaction times, and many other cases. However, the source and significance of these characteristics are unclear. They could arise from fractal properties of ion channels in neurons and have no special role or relevance. On the other hand, they could be deliberately produced at the behavioral level and confer a physiological benefit. By developing and making freely available a standard set of computational tools that implement the most modern algorithms for assessing data for fractal properties, the current project can further our understanding of how sensorimotor systems organize, how behaviors are produced, how sensory information is processed and how perceptions emerge.</AbstractNarration>
