    <AbstractNarration>The goal of Mote Marine Laboratory's (MML) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program is to provide research experiences in estuarine and coastal sciences to undergraduate students in colleges and universities throughout the United States. MML, which is located in Sarasota, FL, will support 10 students to participate in a 10-week research training program. The broader impacts of the program are that it specifically advances understanding and discovery in estuarine and coastal sciences while promoting the education and career development of future ocean science professionals, including underrepresented minorities. This is accomplished by: 1) providing students with direct, "hands-on" experiences in conducting research in diverse research areas within ocean sciences; 2) developing meaningful relationships between students and ocean science professionals; and 3) exposing undergraduates to a variety of skills necessary to pursue a successful career in science. Students are paired with Mote researchers from six research centers and conduct mentored research projects on one of four major threats to coastal habitats: 1) natural toxins, 2) habitat alteration, 3) animal behavior due to habitat change, and 4) coral reef decline. The focus of this program on ocean health is responsive to new calls for a national agenda focused on restoring and protecting aquatic habitats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to improved research skills, students gain invaluable experience in scientific communication by developing and presenting research proposals on their independent projects and reporting their findings in research grant report format and science poster presentations. Career guidance on grantsmanship, scientific writing, presenting poster and oral research talks, and pursuing graduate study in the Ocean Sciences is provided in student-centered discussion groups. Students are also exposed to a broader range of topics in coastal and estuarine sciences by attending research seminars presented by Mote scientific staff, visiting scientists, and Mote REU Program alumni. Participants are encouraged to present research findings in peer-reviewed literature and/or at professional conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support provided by NSF includes funding for student stipends, student travel to and from the site, student housing and meals, and some administrative costs.</AbstractNarration>
