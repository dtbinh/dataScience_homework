    <AbstractNarration>The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary international organization in the field of natural language processing. The ACL's annual conference is the major international conference in this field. This project is to subsidize travel, conference, and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies Student Session. This session is part of the ACL HLT conference to be held on June 19-24, 2011 in Portland, Oregon, USA. The Student Session includes two separate categories of submissions: thesis proposals and research papers. The goal is to provide a forum for students at different stages in their research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Student Session provides a valuable opportunity for the next generation of natural language processing researchers to enter the computational linguistics community. It allows the best students in the field to take their first important step toward becoming professional computational linguists by receiving critical feedback on their work from external experts, and by making contacts with other students and senior researchers in their field. The students who are involved in running and selecting papers for the session also gain valuable opportunities for professional growth and interaction with the researchers on the organizing committee of the main conference. The Student Session contributes to the maintenance and development of a skilled and diverse computational linguistics and natural language processing research community.</AbstractNarration>
