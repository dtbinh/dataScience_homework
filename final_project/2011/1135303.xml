    <AbstractNarration>Abstract of proposal # 1135303: &lt;br/&gt;The 2011 NSF Minority Faculty Development Workshop (MFDW): Engineering Enterprise and innovation, will be the sixth in a series that began in 2001 with funding under the Engineering Directorate. The PI proposes to organize two and a half day workshop at Georgia Tech University. The PI and the university have previous experience in organizing such conferences. This workshop will bring together women and underrepresented minority early and mid career engineering faculty where they have the opportunity to network, learn and discuss their personal experiences and challenges to collaborate with industry. The workshop will provide opportunities for professional development and better understanding of research innovation and translation. Participants will share and develop ideas for projects which are geared towards the development of products and services for commercialization. Also, the workshop will provide a model for an institutionalized minority faculty development program with an emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship that includes mechanisms for assessment and relevant follow up activities. In addition, the workshop will address strategic goals of the National Science Foundation and critical needs of the nation, related to enhance global competiveness and improve the national economy.</AbstractNarration>
