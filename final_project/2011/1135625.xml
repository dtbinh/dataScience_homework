    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 1135625&lt;br/&gt;PI: B. Wayne Bequette&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first joint conference on the Foundations of Computer-Aided Process Operations (FOCAPO) and Chemical Process Control (CPC) will be held in Savannah, Georgia during the second week of January, 2012. The conferences will be held sequentially, with FOCAPO beginning on Sunday evening and ending on Wednesday evening. CPC begins on Tuesday evening and ends on Friday evening. Joint, single-track sessions will be held on Tuesday evening, and Wednesday, with a joint conference dinner on Wednesday evening. Financial support is to cover the registration expenses for 15 young faculty members and 30 graduate students to participate in both conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FOCAPO and CPC have individually been the premier conferences in their respective areas of computer-aided process operations and chemical process control. Recognizing that, particularly from an industrial manufacturing perspective, these areas have a tremendous overlap, a goal of this proposed joint conference is to increase the participation in each individual conference. Ideally, there will be a substantial number of participants that will register for both conferences, sparking interesting interactions and collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds will be used to support 15 young faculty members, and 30 graduate students, who will be encouraged to participate in both conferences. Most of the graduate students attending will be involved as co-authors in the contributed papers session. The organizers will also encourage participation by women and minority graduate students, and will contact U.S. faculty who are active in the area of process operations and control and encourage them to have their more advanced students attend this conference.</AbstractNarration>
