    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and Teachers (RET) Site in Astronomy and Atmospheric Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Haystack Observatory. The program will provide opportunities for undergraduate students and teachers from around the country to actively engage in front-line research in many areas of astronomy, geodesy, and atmospheric science. Program participants will work with individual faculty members and/or observatory staff on focused research projects that last 10 weeks during the summer. The program emphasizes an end-to-end exposure to the research process for the participants. Many of the students will become co-authors on articles published in scientific journals. The very nature of an REU/RET site results in a broader impact, in terms of educational activities. To help broaden the diversity of this program, student and teachers from within Puerto Rico will also be able to participate in this program through a collaboration with Universities within the Ana G. Mendez University System.</AbstractNarration>
