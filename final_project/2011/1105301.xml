    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program focuses on developing an understanding of two kinds of disorder: of electronic spins, and of incoherent (random) displacements of ions in otherwise perfectly crystalline functional materials. In many magnetic systems, there exist temperature regimes where the spins are neither completely disordered nor fully ordered. These regimes are particularly notable in systems with strong magnetic frustration. Analogies between such systems and polar compounds have been recently developed, wherein displacements in the positions of ions from their ideal sites in the structure due to second-order Jahn-Teller distortions result in electric dipoles being formed that remain disordered and incoherent, even at low temperatures. The link between these distinct phenomena is found in magnetoelectric compounds where complex ordering of spins in conical arrangements result in polar, and even ferroelectric ground states in otherwise perfectly centrosymmetric materials, due to coupling of spins with displacements in atomic positions. The goal is to search for new oxide systems where some of these disordering phenomena can be explored, and simultaneously, to develop tools for their understanding. The investigations should lead to better understanding of materials at the forefront of topics in hard-condensed matter science, including quantum spin liquids and ferroelectric metals, and thereby help to build the foundations for the next generation of multifunctional materials for electronics and computing. Finally, the techniques development aspect of the proposed research will contribute to a growing toolkit of probes for understanding structure/function relations in condensed matter. Integral to this undertaking will be the training of the next generation of materials scientists who would develop materials for future advanced technologies.

This research program contributes to precisely this: creating and understanding crystalline solid matter displaying novel behavior that emerges as a result of the complexity of the material. The materials of interest to this program are expected to eventually impact new ways of storing and manipulating matter in beyond-Moore's Law approaches to the processing of information. Integral to this proposal will be the training of undergraduate and graduate students with the skill-sets required to think of new functional materials, to develop strategies to prepare and stabilize them, and to have the expertise to characterize them using state-of-the-art techniques. The seamless integration of computational methods for materials by design into the experimental work will also be an important training goal. The undergraduate and graduate students carrying out the proposed research will also be integrated into outreach programs to local K-12 students, focusing on developing tutorial videos and portable demonstrations that emphasize materials research as an exciting branch of research that is crucial to technological advancement, and whose scientific foundations are based on establishing relations between the composition, structure, and property of materials.
