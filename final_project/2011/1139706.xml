    <AbstractNarration>This EAGER project will perform the initial design and development of a new rock deformation apparatus. The purpose of this apparatus is to study microstructural and rheological phenomena at the pressures and temperatures of Earth's lithosphere and upper asthenospheric mantle. As rock deformation apparatus are not readily available on a commercial basis, funding through the EAGER process will support the exploratory stage design of the new apparatus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of a new rock deformation apparatus will benefit the earth sciences community in a number of ways. The apparatus will be optimized for a critical and under-investigated range of deformation conditions, which will open doors for new research into the nature of Earth's upper mantle and the interiors of other terrestrial planets. This project will assist the development of an early-career scientist; support of this kind is essential given the small size of the rock deformation community. Educational opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers in the PI's lab will be significant, as they will participate in all phases of the design, calibration, and implementation of the new apparatus. This participation will enhance their development as independent scientists, as they learn about some of the underpinnings and assumptions behind their research. The design of the new apparatus will be made publically available, and the details of its construction will be disseminated via the Internet. Access to these designs will benefit early-career scientists and established researchers as they plan their first labs or expand existing labs.</AbstractNarration>
