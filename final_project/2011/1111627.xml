    <AbstractNarration>This CRPA project will develop a game for mobile devices called the "RapidGuppy". It provides users (students 12-21 years of age) with an interesting and fun way to learn details about biological adaptation and genetic change. The game teaches users about the environmental factors that lead to adaptation. More than 30 years of research on the Trinidadian Guppy that "rapidly" evolves (over 3-5 years) is the basis for the game. The research, databases, and mini-documentaries that support the "RapidGuppy" game are linked to allow users to easily delve deeper into these materials. An extensive social media campaign will be used to market the game and the public facing website. Partners in this endeavor include: University of California-Riverside, Habitat Seven, Magmic Inc., and Edu, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the mobile device game will be backed by a sophisticated website that contains detailed research results from the field and mini-documentaries showing real fish and the actual research processes as well as researchers and scientists to promote role model development. Interested individuals may also directly access the videos and research results via the website. The target audiences are youth who are prone to play electronic games and the general public. The comprehensive evaluation plan will assess the learning outcomes resulting from the mini-documentaries, in-game content, and website, as well as the playability of the game and website functionality. Impacts resulting from the social media campaign and outreach to underserved audiences will also be measured. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the major social media campaign, this project may increase the level of interest in the science of evolution and genetic change, and raise awareness of STEM careers. If the user groups become excited about the game and the inherent messages, it is anticipated that the public will gain a better understanding of the factors responsible for genetic change.</AbstractNarration>
