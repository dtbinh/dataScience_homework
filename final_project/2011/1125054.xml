    <AbstractNarration>In this International Collaboration in Chemistry between US Investigators and their Counterparts Abroad (ICC) project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Yves Rubin of the University of California at Los Angeles will develop methods for the solution-phase self-assembly of carbon-rich macrocycles into columnar stacks and study the controlled polymerization of these stacks into nanotubular carbon-rich systems in solution and on surfaces by STM. This work includes an international collaboration with Prof. Yoshito Tobe of Osaka University, Japan. Prof. Tobe's work will be funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS). The ultimate thrust of this project is to achieve carbonization of these nanotubular carbon-rich products into well-defined carbon nanotubes with precise location of side-chains. The research has three complementary components. In the first part, the research will focus on the use of molecular assembly of self-complementary carbon-rich macrocyclic derivatives to achieve the correct stacking parameters that lead to facile thermal topochemical polymerization of columnar stacks of macrocycles. In the second part, controlled polymerization of the carbon-rich macrocycles will be examined and optimized, both within single crystals through heat, irradiation or high pressure, or with self-assembled nanotubules on a surface by pulsed voltage from STM tips, UV irradiation, or heat. Finally, a study of the structures and properties of the resulting carbon nanotubes will determine if they have the desired well-defined widths as well as carbon network and substituent topologies corresponding to their designed molecular precursors. The broader impacts involve training graduate and undergraduate students, enhancing research infrastructure by bringing together an international collaborative group, and the potential societal benefits of a long sought access to well-defined carbon nanotubes with unique electronic properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The availability of carbon nanotubes, ultrasmall tubes comprised of a single layer of carbon atoms, with defined width has been a grand challenge of carbon-based nanotechnology. Ready access to carbon nanotubes with precise dimensions and electronic properties is not yet possible, and this research seeks to solve part of this problem by achieving a controlled formation of large sections of carbon nanotubes. The results of this research could ultimately impact industries and commercial products that would utilize nanoelectronics.</AbstractNarration>
