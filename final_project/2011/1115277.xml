    <AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the precise analytic form of the complex singularities of&lt;br/&gt;the Lorenz system, the figure-eight solution of the three-body problem, and signals obtained&lt;br/&gt;from the Navier-Stokes boundary layer. Both analytic and numerical techniques&lt;br/&gt;will be used. Research on the Lorenz system has the aim of understanding the analytic&lt;br/&gt;continuation of the Lorenz solutions to the entire complex plane. With regard to the&lt;br/&gt;figure-eight solution, the project will show that the complex singularities of this system&lt;br/&gt;have an appealingly simple structure. The Navier-Stokes boundary layer has been&lt;br/&gt;studied primarily using techniques from spectral analysis. We will locate and elucidate&lt;br/&gt;singularities of the analytic continuation of the signal in the complex plane, and and&lt;br/&gt;obtain a measurement as well as an understanding of the time scales imposed by the&lt;br/&gt;outer flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project endeavors to benefit the public in two respects. Firstly, we aim to obtain&lt;br/&gt;new insights into the Navier-Stokes boundary layer which is of immense importance in&lt;br/&gt;engineering and meteorology. As an example of its importance, we mention that a&lt;br/&gt;major part of the energy intake of automobiles is dissipated in the boundary layer.&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, we will write a new book that puts computer architecture at the heart of&lt;br/&gt;scientific computing. This book will introduce a style of scientific computing that is&lt;br/&gt;deeply informed by recent progress in computer architecture to a wider audience.</AbstractNarration>
