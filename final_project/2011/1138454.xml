    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Model organisms are widely used in biology research to understand how fundamental biological processes occur in all animals, including humans. The nematode C. elegans is one of the foremost model organisms, and has been used for groundbreaking insights in multiple areas of biology. C. elegans has many advantages as an experimental system, including powerful genetic approaches, but it lacks an essential tool: there are no C. elegans cell lines. Cell lines are cells that have been isolated from the animal and are able to continuously divide in a tissue culture system. C. elegans cell lines would allow for many experimental approaches that cannot be performed with the whole animal, including biochemical experiments with a homogeneous cell population, RNAi-based gene inactivation screens for cellular defects, and small molecule screens for bioactive compounds that modulate molecular pathways. The cell lines would be available for use by hundreds of laboratories to extend our knowledge of basic processes in a wide array of biological areas. This project seeks to isolate C. elegans cell lines from stem cells of the reproductive system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The project will enhance the research infrastructure by providing a powerful new tool (C. elegans cell lines) that can be used to probe many areas of biological research. Additionally, local K-12 science teachers will participate in summer internships where they will contribute to the research to create a C. elegans cell line. In addition to broadening their research experience, the teachers will learn how to work with C. elegans, which can be used in elementary and high school laboratory courses to effectively teach genetics. Finally, college students will also be involved in carrying out the research, which will contribute to the training of the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>
