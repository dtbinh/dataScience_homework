    <AbstractNarration>The Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) program at the University of North Florida (UNF) is focused on the field of Coastal Biology. The overall goal of this program is to enhance the training and career development of undergraduate science students who have not yet had significant research experience by engaging them in the research and culture of this popular and important field. Ten students will be recruited each summer from a variety of urban universities to participate in a 10-week research-training program conducted at UNF. Because of the focus of this program on younger students with only limited research experience, all students will complete a two-week orientation during which they will receive hands-on training in basic skills of conducting scientific research projects. Afterwards, students will be paired with biologists from UNF or two collaborating institutions and conduct mentored research projects on major threats to coastal biological resources in north Florida waters. Students will develop short research proposals on their projects and deliver an oral presentation on their proposed study to faculty mentors and other REU participants. In Week 10, students will present the results of their mentored projects at a REU poster session open to the entire UNF community. Following the REU period, students will be encouraged to present their research findings at professional conferences and/or in manuscripts submitted to professional journals. Additional career guidance on topics such as developing effective poster presentations, scientific writing, and presenting scientific information to public audiences will be provided in student workshops. Students will also be exposed to a broader range of topics in Coastal Biology by attending research seminars presented by UNF faculty, graduate students, and visiting scientists. Last, participants will complete a research-ethics training component geared towards improving their moral reasoning abilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support provided by NSF includes funding for student stipends, student travel to and from the site, student housing and meals and some administrative costs.</AbstractNarration>
