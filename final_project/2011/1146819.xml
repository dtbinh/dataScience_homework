    <AbstractNarration>It is increasingly recognized that at the molecular level nonlinear networks of heterogeneous molecules control many plant processes, so that systems biology provides a valuable approach in this field, building on the integration of experimental biology with mathematical modeling. One of the biggest challenges to making this integration a reality is that most plant biologists do not possess the mathematical background needed to build and manipulate mathematical models well enough to use them as tools for hypothesis generation. The goal of the project is to develop a network modeling tool, PlantSimLab, that enables plant biologists to build, validate, and use intuitive computer models, with a user interface that does not require mathematical or modeling expertise. No such tool is currently available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PlantSimLab is intended to play the role of a virtual laboratory, in which plant biologists can interrogate a computational model in ways similar to how it is done in the laboratory. The software will be developed in close collaboration with the plant biology community, through use cases that drive software capabilities and interface features. Finally, an extensive dissemination effort will be made to introduce the tool to plant biologists. The project will also leverage an ongoing outreach project that engages 9-12 year-old children across Virginia. The program, Kids' Tech University (KTU), brings 450 children to the Virginia Tech campus 4 times each year, where they interact with scientists, participate in hands-on laboratories, and, between campus events, explore a virtual space related to topics discussed on campus. The project will result in hands-on as well as virtual activities related to plant biology in general and the focus of the proposed project in particular.</AbstractNarration>
