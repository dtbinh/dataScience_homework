    <AbstractNarration>Building on a successful S-STEM scholarship program, called MOSAIC, St. Joseph's College is expanding its well-regarded teacher training program through a Noyce Scholarship project entitled "STEM EMPOWERS." In this program, first- and second-year students carry out education-related internships at various local science-related institutions or in on-campus outreach programs. In their junior and senior years students compete for a Noyce Scholarship in a program that includes teacher preparation as they complete their STEM majors. Experienced STEM professionals who are seeking to change to a teaching career are also supported as they seek a Masters in Mathematics Education degree. These 26 new teachers seek employment as science or mathematics teachers in local high schools in high-need school districts. Since St. Joseph's college attracts a large number of women and students generally underrepresented in STEM disciplines, the new teachers can serve as positive role models to their students while effectively educating them in STEM subjects.</AbstractNarration>
