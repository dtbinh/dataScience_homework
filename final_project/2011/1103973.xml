    <AbstractNarration>This is a proposal for participant travel support to attend the Annual Graduate Student&lt;br/&gt;Probability Conference for the years 2011 and 2012. In 2007, a group of graduate students at the University of Wisconsin at Madison (UW), with assistance from Professor Thomas Kurtz, organized the first Graduate Student Probability Conference. This conference provided students and postdoctoral fellows from across the country with the opportunity to interact with their peers and learn about exciting new directions of research in Probability from some of the leaders in the field.&lt;br/&gt;The fifth conference in the series will be held April 29-May 1, 2011 while the sixth one is tentatively scheduled for April 27-29, 2012. Over the three days of the conference, participants - primarily graduate students and postdocs - will have the opportunity to deliver and attend talks on a variety of topics in Probability Theory.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to student and postdoc speakers, there will be two keynote speakers who will survey recent developments and future directions in their area of expertise each giving three fifty-minute talks. Professor Nathalie Eisenbaum (Laboratoire de Probabilites, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie) and Professor Philip Protter (Cornell/Columbia University) have accepted the invitation to be keynote speakers.</AbstractNarration>
