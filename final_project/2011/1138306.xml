    <AbstractNarration>This grant will support travel and subsistence for graduate students to attend a doctoral symposium held in conjunction with the ESEC/FSE conference taking place this year in Hungary. FSE is the Foundations of Software Engineering symposium, which is a key conference for the core software science and engineering areas of the NSF/CISE/CCF Software and Hardware Foundations (SHF) program. Periodically, FSE is held together with ESEC, the European Conference on Software Engineering, which is the case this year. &lt;br/&gt;The funding will increase the number of US citizens and permanent residents who are able to attend the doctoral symposium, where a distinguished international panel of faculty members will provide feedback on dissertation research. The grant will also help the students travel to the main conference, which is important to their careers. The international experience for the students is also important to the students careers, and contributes to the goal of developing globally aware workforce.</AbstractNarration>
