    <AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to Samford University that will provide research training for 12 students, for 9 weeks during the summers of 2013-2014. The program focuses on multidisciplinary research to study interactions in complex systems ranging from the molecular to the landscape scale in a diverse Appalachian ridge and valley ecosystem at Oak Mountain State Park (OMSP) near Birmingham, AL. There are a wide range of potential student projects, involving both field and laboratory research, to address questions in ecology, population biology, botany, geography, plant chemistry, molecular biology, cell biology and pathogenesis. Mentors are from the Departments of Biological and Environmental Sciences, Chemistry, Geography, and Pharmacy at Samford University. REU students have access to a wide array of individual labs, core facilities (e.g., electron microscopy, LC-MS, cell culture), and the unique OMSP research facility. Students are expected to perform full-time research and to participate in weekly workshops on ethical conduct in research, data analysis, professional communication skills, career opportunities, and the graduate school application process. In addition to the research process, students will participate in professional development activities, and field trips. Discussions with mentors, experts, and fellow students will help participants compare complex biological and biochemical interactions across research topics. Students are selected based on academic record, professional goals, and potential for outstanding research. Outstanding undergraduate students who have limited opportunities to participate in research at their home institutions and students from underrepresented minority groups are particularly encouraged to apply. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. Information about the program will be assessed by various means, including an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting www.Samford.edu/REU, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Malia Fincher at rmfinche@samford.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Betsy Dobbins at egdobbin@samford.edu).</AbstractNarration>
