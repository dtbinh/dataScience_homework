    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates site at the University of Arkansas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program offers ten undergraduate students the opportunity to engage in publishable-quality research projects with scientists working at the forefront of astronomy, planetary science, and space science. Students are supported at the Arkansas Center for Space and Planetary Science for 10 weeks during the summer. Mentors are selected from the scientific staff of the center, progress within the program is monitored through weekly meetings, a mid-term 10 minute oral presentation, and a final poster presentation with a two-page abstract. Program participants will also take part in five field trip to nearby research facilities to illustrate research in a variety of environments. Students are recruited from a variety of locations with a strong emphasis on the recruitment of students from HBCU, Tribal schools, and school with limited research opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
