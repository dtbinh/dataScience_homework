    <AbstractNarration>The study will undertake a systematic search for very low frequency earthquakes (VLFE), along the entire margin of Cascadia subduction zone, from the trench to the down-dip edge of the transition zone. The sources of VLFEs will be located and characterized to better understand the physics of fault slip, particularly at the edges of the locked zone. The study will better characterize the nature of seismic radiation and their spatiotemporal variability along the fault zone in the crust. It is also holed that it will improve our understanding of the full spectrum of the seismic radiation during slow slip episodes, physical mechanism governing slow earthquakes, and their relationship with regular seismicity. It may also shed light on the implications of the slow seismic activities on the nucleation of large damaging earthquakes. The study will form an early career research project for a new postdoc under the mentorsuip of the PI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include support of career development of a new young investigator. The study will examine the seismicity of a subduction zone that can potentially produce great damaging earthquakes. It reflects some of the major goals of the NSF-GeoPRISMS and the Cascadia Initiative, and makes good use of the Amphibious Array. Results from this study may help in planning focused interdisciplinary experiments, and guide the selection of target areas for future research.</AbstractNarration>
