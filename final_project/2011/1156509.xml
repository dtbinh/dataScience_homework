    <AbstractNarration>This funding establishes a new CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates&lt;br/&gt;(REU) site at Salisbury University. The project, called Explore Emerging&lt;br/&gt;Computing in Science and Engineering (EXERCISE), exposes students to&lt;br/&gt;emerging parallel programming models, such as GPGPU languages and MapReduce,&lt;br/&gt;applied to compute intensive problems in computer networks, image and signal&lt;br/&gt;processing, and geographic information system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide an opportunity for twenty-four undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students over a three-year period to participate in a supportive environment&lt;br/&gt;that encourages them to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science. It will&lt;br/&gt;expose these students to parallel programming, which is an area of growing&lt;br/&gt;importance, and offer them the opportunity to present their results at&lt;br/&gt;regional and national professional conferences. The site will recruit&lt;br/&gt;participants from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
