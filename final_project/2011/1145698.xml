    <AbstractNarration>The concept of experimental paleogenetics was proposed more than forty years ago as a way to exploit molecular sequence information to gain a better understanding modern phenotypic diversity. Only recently have computational reconstructions of ancestral sequences been supported by models of character state inference and robust phylogenies. Laboratory synthesis of the inferred genes and proteins has, in turn, guided inference regarding ancestral phenotypes based on the properties of these ancient biomolecules. This approach aims to improve the accuracy in inferring ancient genes though the development of an application in experimental phylogenetics. The approach allows researchers to connect genotype and phenotype for ancestral sequence reconstruction methods in a manner currently not possible. The software uses theoretical and computational simulations to benchmark the performances of various models. The proposed research will extend and experimentally validate the field of ancestral sequence reconstruction, allowing researchers to place confidence in the ability of ancestral sequence reconstruction to facilitate the community's understanding of molecular adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research group participates in teaching and service activities intended to train the next generation of scientists. On one hand, this consists of teaching courses that include Evolutionary Synthetic Biology and Astrobiology. On the other hand, this consists of promoting scientific ideas and training outside of the University setting. For instance, a K-12 science outreach program has been created to promote a diverse learning community and increase the participation of underrepresented groups in evolutionary biology and molecular evolution research.</AbstractNarration>
