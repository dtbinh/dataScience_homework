    <AbstractNarration>The brain-basis of perception is complex, and recent research suggests that neural processing depends on large-scale oscillation of neuronal units. Oscillatory cortical networks detected with electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography recordings often involve several frequency bands, indicating that a multivariate (multi-frequency) analytic approach would have better sensitivity in detecting neural effects than univariate analysis. However, popular connectivity measures, such as coherence and phase synchrony, typically analyze pairs of spatial locations and take into account a single quantity from each location, such as amplitude or phase within a specified frequency band. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Drs. Dimitrios Pantazis, Richard Leahy, and Jintao Jiang will develop robust multivariate statistical methods for detecting brain interactions in electroencephalography. Given the wealth of information in electroencephalography data, analysis using a single frequency approach requires either prior knowledge of the frequencies at which interactions occur or, conversely, a large number of tests, one for each possible type of interaction. In this project, the researchers are using canonical correlation analysis, which can find the optimal combinations of frequencies in one cortical site that best correlate with frequencies at another cortical site. In contrast to conventional methods of interaction analysis, this project is automating the identification of frequency bands that contribute significantly to cortical networks. The target application focuses on audiovisual speech integration effects. The multivariate methods developed in this proposal are being used to detect multisensory interaction cortical sites and account for different levels of phase-resetting from audiovisual speech stimuli with different stimulus onset asynchronies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will facilitate the detection of oscillatory cortical networks both in the normal and pathologic brain. Changes in oscillatory brain activity have been reported in a wide array of neurological diseases, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease, and improved methodologies to detect the presence and differences in oscillatory activity and associated networks will in turn advance the understanding of these diseases and facilitate the development and assessment of therapeutic interventions. This effort brings together engineers and neuroscientists to tackle a broad range of scientific and technological problems, and as a result, the project offers opportunities for integrated interdisciplinary research training of doctoral students. Research results will be disseminated broadly to the research community through professional meetings and journals, and the developed research tools will be distributed to the research community through the open source software BrainStorm.</AbstractNarration>
