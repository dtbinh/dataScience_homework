    <AbstractNarration>(1131192)Dutta- The extraordinary problems posed by fossil fuel use call for our nation and the world to make a transition to clean energy. This is a major and long-term commitment. "Clean energy" encompasses a broad suite of technological approaches in combination with relentless progress towards greater efficiency in our entire system of energy use, from the sources to the social and economic end products. However, the transition to clean energy is not an issue that can simply be addressed by technological advances. Since conventional fuels will remain accessible, the transition to clean energy will only take place if consumers demand clean energy and the business, policy and regulatory environments facilitate the adoption of new approaches over the business-as-usual strategy of combustion. Such a change can only be driven by an energy literate citizenry that understands adopting clean energy is a cornerstone of building a secure future for our nation. Clean energy education is therefore an enabling component of this generational effort, one that will require the highest levels of American expertise and innovation. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will host a workshop that is intended to catalyze the formation of clean energy education programs nationwide. This workshop will bring together government leaders, industry representatives, academic experts, teachers and workforce trainers to chart the way forward to a national program in clean energy education. The workshop will provide a forum for federal agency and industry thought leaders to share their vision for a clean energy economy with academic institutions, outlining challenges, knowledge gaps, and educational needs. This knowledge is fundamental to the development of a national framework for clean energy education, whose goal is to enhance our human capital, a key to innovation and global competitiveness. This workshop will address energy education opportunities across a broad spectrum that includes K-12 schools, community colleges, universities and continuing education in the workplace. It will also foster institutional partnerships necessary to develop and sustain clean energy education programs, creating a pathway towards the goal of nationwide energy literacy. The workshop program, presentations and related educational resources will be placed on the Internet for the public at large. In addition, a final report will be issued that contains recommendations concerning four target areas for energy education: K-12 schools; college and graduate programs; schools of business and government; workforce and continuing education. The report will identify the greatest opportunities for, and the obstacles that might hinder the creation of, programs to reach each of these important audiences. The workshop report will inform policymakers and provide guidance for the development of a national program to prepare an energy literate citizenry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the CBET Environmental Sustainability program in ENG and the Division of Graduate Education in EHR.</AbstractNarration>
