    <AbstractNarration>Roger Williams University (RWU) is implementing the STILAS program to attract, support, graduate, and prepare academically talented STEM students with significant financial need for future success in vital STEM fields. At least 15 students are receiving an annual renewable scholarship of up to $10,000 over four years. STILAS builds on: 1) effective recruitment and comprehensive student support services programs targeting underserved students; 2) university priorities and strengths emphasizing research and other experiences engaging students in practical applications of academic learning; and 3) academic and co-curricular activities that build group identity, enhance learning, and connect students to services and post-graduation opportunities that promote more motivated, accomplished and self-directed graduates in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to their coursework, STILAS students participate in on-going STEM-related activities such as field trips, externships, and competitions as well as cohort-specific experiences (including a mentoring program, tutoring, brown-bag discussions and undergraduate research opportunities). Building on the success of established RWU programs, STILAS participants also receive comprehensive, personalized services from the advising, student advocacy and academic support offices. Program recruitment includes outreach to urban science and technology high schools and a free STEM camp experience to bring promising juniors to campus. STILAS students participate in these outreach activities as role models to attract others into the STEM fields. The project increases the academic grounding and future opportunities for students historically underrepresented in the STEM fields and supports graduates who are ready to enter industry and/or further education. STILAS is building, assessing and disseminating a comprehensive model that can broadly inform STEM outreach to underrepresented students in the U.S.</AbstractNarration>
