    <AbstractNarration>The shift to an ever-increasing number of processing cores--within a&lt;br/&gt;single socket in consumer devices and across multiple sockets in&lt;br/&gt;servers--has brought interconnects to the forefront of the challenges&lt;br/&gt;facing the computing industry. While evidence suggests that&lt;br/&gt;alternatives to conventional metal interconnects will be needed to&lt;br/&gt;meet future performance demands and power constraints, research in&lt;br/&gt;these areas has been largely limited in scope to specific areas of the&lt;br/&gt;computing stack, and little progress has been made across problem&lt;br/&gt;sub-domains. Thus, there is a dire need for holistic research efforts&lt;br/&gt;spanning the stack from physics to systems, and that produce&lt;br/&gt;prototypes and development tools that are of much greater&lt;br/&gt;sophistication than exist today in order to enable commercial&lt;br/&gt;adoption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop on Emerging Technologies for Interconnects will bring&lt;br/&gt;together key researchers, industry developers, and program managers in&lt;br/&gt;order to define an agenda for the research and commercial adoption of&lt;br/&gt;emerging interconnect technologies. Presentations and discussions on&lt;br/&gt;the "state of the state-of-the-art" of emerging technologies for&lt;br/&gt;interconnects will be followed by break-out sessions and discussions.&lt;br/&gt;These sessions will identify and articulate the key research&lt;br/&gt;challenges, and potentially most promising solutions/directions, and&lt;br/&gt;chart the recommended larger-scale national strategy and research&lt;br/&gt;agenda. The broader impact will be the elimination of the key</AbstractNarration>
