    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation, a group led by Professor Christopher Elles at the University of Kansas will study the ultrafast excited-state dynamics of color-changing photochromic molecular switches using time-resolved spectroscopy. Their research will probe the fundamental details that control the transformations of these molecules from one isomer to another following absorption of one or more photons. For example, different excitation schemes allow the dynamics through a conical intersection to be probed via different reaction pathways. Selectively controlling the dynamics for a range of model compounds will provide new insight on the non-adiabatic transitions that are ubiquitous in photochemistry and photophysics, in addition to providing detailed insight on the properties and limitations of the photochromic compounds that will be studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of these experiments will be widely applicable to understanding the dynamics of photon-initiated chemical reactions. In addition to the broad scientific impact, this five-year program also includes an educational outreach program that will train future science teachers to incorporate advanced topics into the high school curriculum. The educational program will engage undergraduate students enrolled in the UKanTeach teacher licensure program and work with them to develop novel lesson plans that will translate key concepts from the field of chemical dynamics into the classroom. Providing meaningful scientific training for prospective secondary science teachers will enhance the impact of the research and invigorate the high school curriculum with a direct connection to modern research.</AbstractNarration>
