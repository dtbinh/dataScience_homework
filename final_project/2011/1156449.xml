    <AbstractNarration>The REU program in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cincinnati will bring 11 students to campus for ten weeks each summer to conduct research in a stimulating, supportive research environment. These students will conduct original research projects together with participating faculty members and their research groups. Projects will be planned in such a way as to permit tangible accomplishments in a ten-week period, yet be sufficiently open-ended that fresh research challenges will arise. Each student will have the opportunity to contribute to scientific knowledge, including refereed publication and presentation at an appropriate scientific meeting. The program will further the development of the REU students as young professional scientists and researchers through a series of educational and professional development activities. These will prepare the REU students to enter the pipeline as informed, knowledgeable professionals with a clear understanding of the challenges and opportunities before them. In addition, a new industrial mentoring program will be established with scientists from Procter &amp; Gamble, the Fortune 500 American multinational corporation headquartered in downtown Cincinnati. The industrial scientists will mentor the students, help to build their self-confidence, and increase their awareness of the role of a chemist in industry. A focus on minority recruiting combined with the involvement of a faculty member from an Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in the program, and collaboration with Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio, will expand and strengthen the pool of underrepresented minorities in the workplace. Advancement of underrepresented students is expected to have a broad societal impact that will be complemented by the expected positive effects of the research outcomes.</AbstractNarration>
