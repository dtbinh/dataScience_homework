    <AbstractNarration>Developers spend most of their time debugging software. This effort&lt;br/&gt;results in perfective changes to their applications, but is otherwise&lt;br/&gt;lost. No central repository exists that stores all bug descriptions&lt;br/&gt;and fixes. The reason for this state of affairs is the belief that&lt;br/&gt;debugging is an idiosyncratic, context-specific task that does not&lt;br/&gt;generalize. In contrast, this project hypothesizes that applications&lt;br/&gt;decompose into smaller, similar problems and that limitations of the&lt;br/&gt;human mind imply that we are likely to make similar errors when&lt;br/&gt;confronted by similar problems. In practice, most developers&lt;br/&gt;agree. When fixing a bug, a developer often begins by searching for&lt;br/&gt;similar bugs that have been reported and resolved in the past, because&lt;br/&gt;a fix for a similar bug can help him understand his bug, or even&lt;br/&gt;directly fix his bug. In short, the problem is that the knowledge&lt;br/&gt;gained during debugging is wasted---either not stored or not&lt;br/&gt;searchable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to revolutionize debugging by capturing and reusing&lt;br/&gt;debugging knowledge. Developers can leverage the knowledge of the&lt;br/&gt;community to speed up debugging. To this end, it proposes to create a&lt;br/&gt;universal bug repository capable of storing all bug information,&lt;br/&gt;indexed on bug traces. To speed debugging, this repository will&lt;br/&gt;support efficiently finding similar bugs and their fixes. It will be&lt;br/&gt;the basis of automatic debugging tools that match closed bugs to an&lt;br/&gt;open bug, then test the applicability of their fixes to that open&lt;br/&gt;bug. Programmers will consult the proposed bug repository as a matter&lt;br/&gt;of course during debugging. Monitors that compare the current&lt;br/&gt;execution against traces in the repository can also prevent bugs and&lt;br/&gt;improve software reliability. This project promises to significantly&lt;br/&gt;speed up debugging and reduce software production cost. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;educational innovations and outreach efforts can also help train more&lt;br/&gt;capable IT professionals for the workforce.</AbstractNarration>
