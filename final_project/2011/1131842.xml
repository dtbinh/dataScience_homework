    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to explore synchronization of motion among hair cells of the inner ear, and its role in the overall sensitivity of mechanical detection. The PI will create a hybrid system, in which a biological preparation containing live and functional cells is interfaced with artificial polymer membranes. This will enable direct measurements of the onset and dynamics of synchronization between oscillatory cells. Polymer membranes of different material properties will be used to allow variation in the strength of inter-cell connections, and their sizes will be varied so as to couple different numbers of elements. Electronic circuits will also be introduced that mimic the role of neural control of hair cells. Voltage signals will be applied across the sensory epithelium in conjunction with the mechanical sensitivity measurements, and a feedback circuit will maximize the responsiveness of the preparation. The hybrid preparation will provide a system in which coupling and adaptive behavior can be independently varied, and hence the role of these two important elements can be quantitatively assessed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscale sensitivity of detection by the auditory system has still not been fully explained, and these experiments are designed to identify the missing components in our understanding of its underlying mechanisms. The project constitutes the first step towards the construction of a bio-mimetic device that can replicate the behavior of the cochlea, with the long-term goal of creating an implantable artificial mechanical sensor. The educational efforts of the PI aim to train graduate and undergraduate students in techniques at the interface of physics, engineering, and biology, via new courses introduced into the curriculum, undergraduate research programs, and an inter-departmental discussion forum.</AbstractNarration>
