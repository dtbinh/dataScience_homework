    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports the Texas Algebraic Geometry Symposium (TAGS). TAGS is a weekend regional meeting held each spring since 2005, hosted in turn by Rice University, the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&amp;M University. The workshop brings together many senior mathematicians from Texas and neighboring states. Although many participating institutions have Algebraic Geometry seminars that run through the academic year, the audience at each location is small. TAGS provides regional concentration benefits: we have many speakers in a short time who can reach many listeners in one place. We aim to bring a diverse collection of excellent speakers who are doing cutting-edge research across the many subfields of Algebraic Geometry. Background talks are given for the benefit of students and young researchers; there is a poster session for graduate students to afford them both feedback from and exposure to experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry is a broad field of mathematics concerned with the study of solutions to systems of polynomial equations. It has amply documented connections to many areas of mathematics (number theory symplectic geometry, representation theory, mathematical physics, etc.), and its applications reverberate in a variety of contexts (robotics, coding theory, complexity theory, etc.). Conferences like TAGS help algebraic geometers stay abreast of current developments in this rapidly-evolving area of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
