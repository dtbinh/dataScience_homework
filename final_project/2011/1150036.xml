    <AbstractNarration>Most of the today's computers are parallel machines. For example, multicore processors&lt;br/&gt;on personal computers and cell phones, graphics processors, cloud&lt;br/&gt;computers, and clusters all have more than one processing unit. &lt;br/&gt;Many modern applications are data intensive; examples include digital signal processing, audio and video&lt;br/&gt;processing, networking, scientific and biological computations.&lt;br/&gt;Streaming is an increasingly popular paradigm for applications that process &lt;br/&gt;large amounts of data in parallel. A streaming concurrency platform is responsible for&lt;br/&gt;correctly and efficiently executing streaming applications on a given parallel machine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to design streaming concurrency platforms&lt;br/&gt;that provide guarantees of forward progress and efficiency. This&lt;br/&gt;research will fundamentally advance the technology by addressing &lt;br/&gt;the following important questions: &lt;br/&gt;(1) How to guarantee that applications will make forward progress (not&lt;br/&gt;deadlock)? &lt;br/&gt;(2) How to guarantee that the streaming applications will run efficiently&lt;br/&gt;on modern parallel machines with deep and complex memory hierarchies?&lt;br/&gt;and&lt;br/&gt;(3) How to support more general and expressive streaming models while&lt;br/&gt;still providing correctness and performance guarantees? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In modern machines cache locality can have a significant impact on&lt;br/&gt;performance. This research has the potential to make fundamental&lt;br/&gt;contributions to both design and analysis techniques for steaming&lt;br/&gt;schedulers that guarantee good cache performance to streaming applications.&lt;br/&gt;This work will enable programmers to express a larger class of applications more&lt;br/&gt;easily in the streaming model. While this research project is a primarily theoretical undertaking&lt;br/&gt;aimed towards designing algorithms and proving asymptotic bounds on&lt;br/&gt;their performance, the overall goal is to enable practical and&lt;br/&gt;efficient concurrency platforms that can run high-performance,&lt;br/&gt;high-throughput streaming computations on real parallel machines.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, one of the primary objectives will be to design low overhead&lt;br/&gt;and simple algorithms that can be implemented in production-level&lt;br/&gt;streaming concurrency platforms.</AbstractNarration>
