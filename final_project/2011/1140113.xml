    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing an illustrated undergraduate text in projective geometry applied to perspective art, which is suitable for use in sophomore- or junior-level mathematics courses for mathematics majors, students pursuing computer graphics, or mathematically talented art majors. The project builds on the prior NSF-funded work of one of the PIs, which resulted in the publication of the undergraduate text, "Viewpoints: Mathematical Perspective and Fractal Geometry in Art" and a series of Viewpoints Mathematics and Art workshops for undergraduate instructors. The project is 1) developing a series of materials (papers, classroom modules, homework exercises), 2) testing the materials in the classes at Franklin and Marshall College and Southwestern University and evaluating these materials formally, 3) presenting these materials (via talks, journal publications, web distribution, and mini-courses) to other instructors for their feedback, and 4) publishing, marketing, and disseminating the text. This course enhances knowledge of geometry and gives readily-accessible applications that can be used in teaching, in studies where this type of projective geometry course is relevant, and in fulfilling mathematics course requirements with content that is relevant to non-mathematics majors.</AbstractNarration>
