    <AbstractNarration>Proposal: OISE- 1131011&lt;br/&gt;PI/Institution: Hsieh, M. Ani, Drexel University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. M. Ani Hsieh from Drexel University and Dr. Rafael Fierro from the University of New Mexico propose to organize an International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program with Brazilian collaborators Dr. Luiz Chaimowicz and Dr. Mario Campos both from the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to develop a multi-faceted approach to study multi-robot system for reliable execution of large scale cooperative tasks. The PIs will focus on four main topics related to multi-robot systems and cooperative control: (a) execution of complex task using robot swarms; (b) distributed autonomous assembly; (c) ensemble synthesis of distributed coordination strategies; and (d) intentional sensing via prioritized detection and active learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year IRES program also provides undergraduate and graduate students with a unique opportunity to work with an interdisciplinary and international research on the design of multi-robot systems integrating theory and hardware. The students will also gain new perspectives on the use of autonomous robots to accomplish coordinated tasks within a complex environment and with limited resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is jointly funded by the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems of the NSF Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering and the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
