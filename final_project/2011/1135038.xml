    <AbstractNarration>This workshop convenes many of the nation's experts on atmospheric measurements of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) to define the current state of the science in this area. The emphasis will be on the Southeastern U.S., which previous field studies and modeling suggest is a "hotspot" for BVOC emissions to the atmosphere. BVOCs are a globally significant emission to the atmosphere; they have a major impact on ozone production, with secondary effects on ecosystems and human health. New techniques and infrastructure will also be discussed. A major goal of the workshop is to bring together established senior researchers and early career scientists with new and different perspectives to provide opportunities for professional interactions in a focused and productive forum. The discussion outcomes will be reported in a peer-reviewed journal publication.</AbstractNarration>
