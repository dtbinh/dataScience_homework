    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and physical Sciences Directorate supports Florida State University to host the NSF's Large Facilities Workshop in Tallahassee, FL, on April 19-21, 2011. The 2011 NSF Large Facilities Workshop will share the goals of previous workshops, which are to bring together program directors, facility managers and others involved in large facility management, to discuss common issues and learn from each other?s experiences. The emphasis is on facility operation rather than scientific research. Specific goals include discussions of facility operating experiences, development of personal contacts between facilities, education on current issues, and discussions of current concerns. &lt;br/&gt;The awardee operates the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL). The NHMFL is a network of three institutions, the University of Florida in Gainesville, and the the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. It is the only national user facility of its kind in the United States. It has the largest and highest-powered magnet laboratory in the world. &lt;br/&gt;The meeting will occur over 3 days, and include plenary sessions, breakout discussions, and field trips to large facilities at FSU (NHMFL and The Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility. &lt;br/&gt;The meeting will contribute to the advancement of knowledge and understanding of large facilities operators by facilitating dissemination of, and access to, information regarding the efficient management of large facilities. By seeking out and sharing better ways to operate and manage these facilities, administrators can strengthen, broaden and perpetuate the capabilities of NSF-supported research infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
