    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop signal processing system design solutions to enable high-performance and low-cost hybrid solid-state/magnetic hard disk drives with beyond 1 Tbit per square inch areal density. The proposed research aims to cohesively develop powerful signal processing algorithms and low-cost VLSI architecture solutions that can simultaneously address the low signal-to-media-noise ratio and high system fault tolerance implementation cost faced by the emerging hybrid shingled written recording systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the theme of developing unified signal processing system design solutions from both theory and practical implementation perspectives. New non-controllable trellis-based finite-state detectors and their efficient VLSI architectures will be developed to address the loss of signal-to-media-noise ratio caused by shingled writing. A unified read channel design approach and a data-management-aware signal processing strategy will be further developed to reduce the overall system signal processing implementation cost. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed research is that it will enable the development of low-cost ultra-high capacity mass data storage drives to accommodate the exploding global data volume. It also contributes greatly to sustaining the historical magnetic recording areal density growth rate, providing a direct benefit to this strategically important high technology sector critical to the economic health of the nation. Extra effort will be made to recruit women and other under-represented groups as research assistants in this project, involve representatives of the Pacific Islander minority as undergraduate researchers, and reach out to high school students as part of outreach efforts.</AbstractNarration>
