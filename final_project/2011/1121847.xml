    <AbstractNarration>Alexandra C. C. Wilson&lt;br/&gt;Proposal # IOS-1121847&lt;br/&gt;Characterization of Aphid Nutrient Amino Acid Transporters with Focus on the&lt;br/&gt;Symbiotic Interface&lt;br/&gt;Symbioses such as those between humans and their gut flora and the insect vector of&lt;br/&gt;Chagas disease and its obligate bacterium are ubiquitous in nature impacting human&lt;br/&gt;health, biodiversity and agriculture. Insects feeding on mammalian blood or plant sap&lt;br/&gt;are united in their dependence on intimate symbioses with bacteria that nutritionally&lt;br/&gt;compensate their hosts. While the nutritional bases of these symbioses are well&lt;br/&gt;understood, the processes and structures that mediate the intimate interactions between&lt;br/&gt;symbiotic partners have been neglected and remain uncharacterized. This project aims&lt;br/&gt;to functionally characterize the processes and structures that mediate amino acid&lt;br/&gt;exchange between aphids and their bacterial symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola. Buchnera live&lt;br/&gt;within membrane-bound compartments inside aphid bacteriocyte cells. The membranes&lt;br/&gt;of the bacteriocytes and the specialized compartments present a challenge to amino acid&lt;br/&gt;exchange, a process vital to aphid survival. Specifically, this project focuses on studying&lt;br/&gt;the molecules that transport amino acids across membranes at the aphid/Buchnera&lt;br/&gt;interface. The investigators will experimentally determine the transport capability of&lt;br/&gt;amino acid transporters and use microscopy to determine where these transporters are&lt;br/&gt;found. Research and educational goals will merge in measurement of changes in&lt;br/&gt;expression of amino acid transporter genes in response to dietary amino acid supply&lt;br/&gt;providing inquiry-based research training for up to 96 undergraduates. Broadly this&lt;br/&gt;work benefits genomic studies in all insect systems and additionally provides mentoring&lt;br/&gt;and research training for one graduate student and one early-career researcher. This&lt;br/&gt;project will be the first to functionally characterize the processes and structures&lt;br/&gt;operating at the interface of an insect nutritional symbiosis. Importantly, understanding&lt;br/&gt;how insects interact with their symbionts has the potential to facilitate development of&lt;br/&gt;targeted environmentally safe control of insect vectors of human and plant disease.</AbstractNarration>
