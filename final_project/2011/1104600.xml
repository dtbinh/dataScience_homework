    <AbstractNarration>Technical: This project is an in-depth investigation of the electrical behavior at the interface of ZnO bulk, thin film and nanowire systems at various temperatures and in different ambient environments, under illumination, and with varying wire length, film thickness and bulk orientation. Although the optical properties of ZnO nanowires are beginning to receive attention, there is very little discussion concerning their electrical properties, specifically in single wire configurations. Recent studies of films and bulk material suggest that the ZnO/ambient interface may significantly contribute to conductive properties, which may be related to the irreproducible and unstable p-type conductivity of ZnO. Both the lack of reliable p-type doping and the relative lack of information on these interface contributions significantly challenges progress in ZnO device applications and the understanding of the electrical behavior on the nano-scale. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. This study will further the understanding of processes at the interface of bulk and nano-scale ZnO, which could lead to the future growth of more reliable material, resulting in higher reliability, longer lifetime, and higher efficiency bright light sources, UV detectors, and gas sensors. Coastal Carolina University is a primarily undergraduate institution with a history of recruiting underrepresented minorities and women in physics. Undergraduate students, including those in under-represented groups, will be trained for surface electrical properties by atomic force microscopy (AFM) based techniques.</AbstractNarration>
