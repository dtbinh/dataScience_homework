    <AbstractNarration>This research aims to develop an accurate and efficient method for reliability analysis of computationally and probabilistically complex structural engineering problems that cannot be accurately solved with current reliability methods without high-cost simulation approaches. This will be accomplished by formulating a simulation-based approach based on the method of conditional expectation and estimation of the probability density of the simulated results in the critical region of interest. The project will develop an optimal algorithm for probability density construction, a method to estimate error in the calculated reliability, and a new and accurate approach for efficient simulation utilizing variance reduction techniques. The methods developed in the project will be validated on a database of benchmark reliability problems as well as selected complex structural reliability problems representative of engineering practice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is expected to advance structural safety analysis for a variety of complex, high-fidelity engineering problems such as crash, impact, and blast analysis; metal forming; and complex structural system evaluation in various engineering disciplines. The work will provide advanced training to undergraduate and graduate students with their possible recruitment from underrepresented groups through existing university outreach programs. Selected research results will be incorporated in the structural engineering curriculum to expose students to state-of-the-art safety analysis methods.</AbstractNarration>
