    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The American Society of Plant Biologists will host a Plant Science Research Summit at the Conference Center of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Chevy Chase, MD on September 22-23, 2011. The summit will engage the broad plant science research community in a process to develop a consensus plan to invigorate and guide plant science research over the next decade. The summit will bring together representatives of the full spectrum of plant science research, from basic to applied, to identify critical gaps in our understanding of plant biology that must be filled over the next 10 years or more to address grand challenges, such as those in health, energy, food, and environmental sustainability. The primary product of the summit will be a report suggesting a decadal plan for investments in plant science research, describing the contributions of plant science to addressing important scientific priorities and vital societal challenges. The report will be made widely available, and several dissemination activities are planned. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The Plant Science Research Summit will help bring together the broad plant science community across a variety of sectors, model systems, institution types, scientific approaches, and other dimensions. The participants in the summit will also be drawn from the community in a way that maximizes diversity by gender, geography, age, disability, and other characteristics. An extensive dissemination plan is proposed that will bring the results of the project throughout and beyond the plant science community. This will help broaden the reach of the project and of plant science to new communities. The report will be written with a minimum of technical language so that it can be accessible to a wide range of readers including policymakers, funders, educators, opinion leaders, and others. Moreover, the results of the project are expected to be broadly applicable not only to help guide research directions over the next decade, but to provide a framework for education about the big questions in plant science. It is expected that professional societies and other stakeholders will be able to develop educational materials related to the priorities identified in the report.</AbstractNarration>
