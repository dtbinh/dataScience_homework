    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary: The program focuses on developing a new class of high-resolution, high-speed, low-power-consumption, full-color electronic paper displays (E-PADs) using molecular motors as active components. The specific molecular motors to be used are redgreen-blue (RGB) tri-station catenanes. The proposed research will (1) investigate the electrochromic properties of RGB catenanes in polymeric matrix, and (2) construct a prototype color-switchable E-PAD based on RGB catenanes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Artificial molecular motors and machines such as RGB catenanes represent a promising and challenging field of interdisciplinary research. If successful, this research could lead to a new technology for energy efficient, high speed and full color display technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: In addition to its technical contributions, this NSF project will impact society by implementing vigorous education and outreach programs that are closely integrated with the proposed research and designed for groups at all levels. Underrepresented students will participate extensively in the proposed research.</AbstractNarration>
