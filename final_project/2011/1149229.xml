    <AbstractNarration>Virtualization is an increasingly popular strategy for users to run applications designed for one platform on another platform---the holy grail of write once, run anywhere. The caveat for virtualization is that 'anywhere' has to be a powerful system with resources to spare. In a virtual machine, users can bundle an application with all of its operating system dependences in an easily-migrated environment---as long as users are willing to drag along duplicate networking stacks, CPU schedulers, virus scanners, swapping heuristics, and so on. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates a radical restructuring of the operating system in order to reduce these redundancies and overheads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is driven by a vision of the future where each application and system service runs in a dedicated virtual machine; moreover, the operating system is no longer a single piece of software running on bare hardware, but its functionality is decomposed into several independent layers between the virtual machine monitor and the unmodified application. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates previously unstudied classes of applications and host services, as well as new system layers for hardware management and storage, with the end goal of making per-application virtual machines practical on mobile devices. If successful, this research will establish a richer scientific understanding of the trade-offs in computer system design and dramatically improve the efficiency and flexibility of modern computer systems.</AbstractNarration>
