    <AbstractNarration>Funding for this project supports the acquisition of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) to augment research and education opportunities at Ball State University and beyond. The new TEM will enhance existing research projects spanning the biology, chemistry, physiology, nanoscience, and physics departments. Some of these projects include: 1) structural plasticity in the developing nervous system; 2) the effects of chemical stressors on aquatic ecosystems; 3) the role of metabolism in organ development; 4) development of novel luminescent thin films for non-invasive biological imaging; 5) cellular mechanisms of endocytosis; 6) synthesis of functional carbon nanotubes; 7) and development of novel photocatalytic solid surface materials for organic decontamination and air purification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new TEM will be housed in Ball State University?s newly constructed Micro-Imaging Center that serves the greater East Central Indiana region. This instrument will be available to all departments within the university and used by both nearby undergraduate institutions and industrial partners. Students in a graduate course will work on individual projects aimed at optimizing conditions for investigators? sponsored research projects currently underway or those about to be undertaken. Such an approach aims to blur the lines between education and research, ultimately resulting in increased research productivity and direct student participation. The TEM will be demonstrated to local high school students who routinely visit the facility as a means of promoting science and research. The instrument will also be used to strengthen our existing ties to the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program, for which multiple investigators currently serve as mentors. This device will be the only one of its kind in the region, and will serve as a critical component in broadening the education and research opportunities of the&lt;br/&gt;diverse student body at Ball State University and beyond while also promoting scientific collaboration among interdisciplinary researchers.</AbstractNarration>
