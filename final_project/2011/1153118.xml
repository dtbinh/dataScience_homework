    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Kenneth J. Shea of the University of California, Irvine will develop new green chemistries for the production of hydrocarbon macromolecules from single carbon atom, renewable feedstocks (C1). The approach is to separate and study the mechanisms of the individual steps in the polymerization (initiation, propagation (early, middle and late stage), termination); to prepare reaction intermediates and measure their stabilities; and to prepare compounds necessary to enable and study the formation of stable polyethylene latexes. The broader impacts involve training undergraduate and graduate students in fundamental polymer chemistry, broadly disseminating research results via publications and presentations at conferences, participating in outreach activities through the UC Irvine Environment Institute, and the potential societal impacts of manufacturing hydrocarbon compounds and materials from renewable resources. Students will also work with industrial partners to explore large-scale applications of this chemistry for producing useful materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastics are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices. At present, plastics are derived predominantly from petroleum based resources. This research will provide fundamental chemical knowledge that could be used to develop efficient, economical and practical methods for the production of plastics and waxes from abundant and sustainable carbon sources.</AbstractNarration>
