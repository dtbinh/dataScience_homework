    <AbstractNarration>SES - 1131157&lt;br/&gt;Erin Leahey (PI)&lt;br/&gt;Sharon Koppman (co-PI)&lt;br/&gt;University of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral Dissertation Research: Socialization and Creativity in the Advertising Industry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The industries that produce intellectual property, also known as "creative industries," play a pivotal role in the economies of advanced countries. Yet, we know little about what influences people who work in the creative industries. This study examines whether socialization patterns affect selection into creative positions and how professionals in the field attain legitimacy. This project focuses on the case of advertising professionals employed in the creative and accounts departments of advertising agencies. Within this context, the project examines the link between socialization patterns and creativity: whether early exposure to diverse ideas and cultural forms increases the chance that an individual will seek out a creative position. This project will also contribute to the theoretical debate on culture and inequality by demonstrating how cultural signals are used to gain legitimacy in the workplace. Data will be collected through a survey distributed to a random sample of advertising professionals. In addition, the study involves forty semi-structured interviews with professionals employed in elite advertising agencies and four months of participant observation within an agency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;This project has practical implications for employers as well as educators preparing students to enter the creative industries. Labor markets in advanced industrialized countries around the world are shifting towards occupations related to the knowledge economy, including but not limited to the creative sector. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the European Commission and the United States Census, creative industries are the fastest growing sector in many industrialized countries. By contributing to our understanding of this large and growing economic sector, the project may inform our ability to maximize global competitiveness. Findings from this study may also inform training and education programs that focus on providing cultural literacy with the goal to train the next generation of professionals in the field.</AbstractNarration>
