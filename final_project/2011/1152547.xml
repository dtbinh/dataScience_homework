    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Richard van Duyne of Northwestern University and his postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate student researchers will be supported to continue their investigations of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Prof. Van Duyne and his research group will work on: (1) developing single-molecule SERS (SMSERS) and applying it to electrochemical measurements and (2) conducting fundamental studies of surface-enhanced femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy. Professor Van Duyne will continue his wide-ranging activities in education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a molecular species is adsorbed to a metal surface with high curvature, there is a large enhancement of the Raman scattering. Prof. Van Duyne and other scientists are interested in understanding the mechanism for this enhancements and using it as a means of improving the detection of chemical species in low concentration. Already, plasmonic sensors have been developed for medical diagnostics and the detection of chemical warfare agents. The goal of work like this is to build more sensitive chemical detectors. The students working on this project will gain useful experience in developing cutting-edge analytical spectroscopy tools as well as developing a firm understanding of the chemistry and physics behind the SERS effect. As part of this work, Prof. Van Duyne will continue his broad-ranging efforts in education, and he will continue in his efforts at encouraging students from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
