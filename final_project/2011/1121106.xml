    <AbstractNarration>Plants and animals are consistently colonized by bacteria, and these&lt;br/&gt;symbiotic microorganisms often contribute to beneficial processes and/or disease&lt;br/&gt;in their hosts. Many symbiotic bacteria communicate using pheromone signals,&lt;br/&gt;allowing them to coordinate group behaviors during infection. Such pheromone&lt;br/&gt;signaling is typically called ?quorum sensing?, because high cell density is&lt;br/&gt;necessary for pheromones to build up. However, a ?quorum? is typically not&lt;br/&gt;sufficient to induce pheromone-mediated behaviors fully, and bacterial&lt;br/&gt;pheromones are not simply census-taking signals. Importantly, the pheromones&lt;br/&gt;may also function to communicate aspects of the host environment among the&lt;br/&gt;bacteria. This project will use genetic, molecular, microscopic, and microbiological&lt;br/&gt;approaches in exploiting the tractable model symbiosis between the&lt;br/&gt;bacterium Vibrio fischeri and its natural host squid Euprymna scolopes to&lt;br/&gt;examine the relationship between conditions in the host and the symbiont?s use&lt;br/&gt;of pheromones. Pheromone signaling was discovered in V. fischeri and it&lt;br/&gt;remains among the best-understood model systems for such study. The&lt;br/&gt;symbiotic infection occurs in transparent tissue that is only colonized by V.&lt;br/&gt;fischeri, and pheromone signaling during infection results in the emission of&lt;br/&gt;bioluminescence by the bacteria, making the infection relatively simple and the&lt;br/&gt;regulatory output easy to monitor. The scientific aims of this project are to&lt;br/&gt;determine what aspects of the host environment lead to the induction of bacterial&lt;br/&gt;bioluminescence and to determine what role pheromones play in communicating&lt;br/&gt;conditions in the host. A third aim is to integrate research on bacteria-host&lt;br/&gt;symbioses into undergraduate education, both through direct emersion in&lt;br/&gt;research and through the generation of materials to facilitate in-class discussion&lt;br/&gt;of scientific papers. The project will provide insight into the environment&lt;br/&gt;symbiotic bacteria encounter in a host, and how their perception of the host&lt;br/&gt;environment can be integrated with their use of pheromones. The project will&lt;br/&gt;also help train young scientists.</AbstractNarration>
