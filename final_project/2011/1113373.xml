    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop new sensor materials for detection of trace mercury in water systems, based on a patent-pending technique licensed by MetalloSensors. This technique at its current stage provides both high sensitivity (with detection limit as low as in sub ppb) and selectivity (against other common coexisting metal ions), demonstrating promise for future development into portable, easy-to-use devices for onsite water monitoring of mercury. It is the goal of this Phase I project to develop the new generation of sensor molecules that are suited for water assays, while still maintaining the unique sensing features as achieved for the current version of sensors. These new molecules will be incorporated into a prototype detecting device through a series of tests and optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are two-fold: first, it will help MetalloSensors verify the technical feasibility of manufacturing cheap, portable, easy-to-use, but accurate fluorescence-based detectors, suitable for expedient mercury monitoring in water environments; second, the innovative products of MetalloSensors will offer strong market competition over the traditional bench-top instruments, which are usually expensive and complicated to operate. A substantial, sustainable market exists for the innovative mercury detectors as evidenced by the increasing need of water analysis and global concern of mercury pollution. The current US market size for mercury detection was estimated as $0.25B/year, while in China the market size can be as large as $1.5B/year, and this figure is expected to grow significantly in the future.</AbstractNarration>
