    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The Nanoelectronic Devices for Defense &amp; Security (NANO-DDS)&lt;br/&gt;Conference is a bi-annual science and technology event which has been organized for the&lt;br/&gt;purpose of reviewing the evolving research and development (R&amp;D) activities in the&lt;br/&gt;arena of nanoelectronic devices that have direct relevance to critical capability needs for&lt;br/&gt;national defense &amp; security in the future. The charter of this special conference is to unify&lt;br/&gt;and focus the very broad array of nanoelectronic and supporting nanotechnology&lt;br/&gt;activities that are currently engaged in reaching the long expected applications payoffs in&lt;br/&gt;core defense and security related areas such as sensing, data processing, computation and&lt;br/&gt;communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The inherent multidisciplinary nature of the nanoscale science &amp;&lt;br/&gt;technology (Nano-S&amp;T) field and the potential for impacting high priority objectives&lt;br/&gt;motivate the unique organization of this 2011 conference. The conference will support participation of many new faculty and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
