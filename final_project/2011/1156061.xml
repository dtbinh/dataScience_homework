    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funds to support graduate students and junior researchers to attend a conference entitled "Advances in Lubrication: Linking Molecular, Meso, and Machine Scales," to be held in Puntarenas, Costa Rica, January 8-13, 2012. The objective of this conference is to establish links from the nanoscale up through the machine scale so that major advances in lubrication science may be achieved and disseminated. All mechanical systems with moving, contacting parts are subject to tribological interactions, and therefore lose energy. It has been speculated that energetic and mechanical losses annually in the USA alone are at least a few percentage of its GDP which corresponds to billions of dollars, and that about 5% of the energy in an automobile is lost to friction. The control and understanding of friction, lubrication, and wear is thus of extreme importance, especially as energy, sustainability, and the environment become major global concerns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring together approximately 70 scientists from a wide variety of fields (microscopy, molecular modeling, surface science, automotive and space systems), disciplines (physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, mechanical engineering), and interests (biotribology and bio-inspired lubrication, tribochemistry, and even consumer level tribology, such as shampoos, skis, and tissues) to stimulate discussion and that will lead to major advances in the field. Two plenary speakers, six additional invited speakers, and numerous contributed talks and posters will be presented. The format is designed to allow ample time for discussion, questions, and networking. Participants will range from academia to national laboratories to industry. Pending further discussions with the publisher, a conference proceedings will be published in the journal Tribology Letters. An executive summary and final report will be prepared for the sponsor to document the outcomes of the conference.</AbstractNarration>
