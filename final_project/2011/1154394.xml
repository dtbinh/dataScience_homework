    <AbstractNarration>The Quantitative and Analytical Sciences for Academic Reinforcement and Success (QuASARS) project at Texas Woman's University (TWU) is increasing the STEM workforce in the United States by providing cross-disciplinary training in quantitative and analytical science for S-STEM scholars and TWU STEM majors. In an increasingly technological world, boundaries between traditional STEM fields are narrowing and many careers require training at their interface. QuASARS prepares S-STEM undergraduates for these exciting careers. Based in successes of prior programs, the number of STEM majors at TWU has increased, their persistence facilitated by a cohort of scholars engaging in hands-on STEM experiences. The current program fosters development of a cohort of students united by an interest in quantitative and analytical sciences and obtaining degrees in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, computer science and mathematics. The TWU S-STEM program facilitates degree progression and entrance into advanced degree programs and STEM careers. Each year, the TWU S-STEM program provides scholarships for approximately 20 academically talented, but financially challenged students, who also obtain a certificate in Quantitative Sciences. The certificate is available to all STEM students at TWU and promotes student cohesiveness and preparedness for STEM professions. The success of the TWU S-STEM program is assessed by evaluating QuASARS recruiting strategies, the efficacy of support efforts provided by the program (e.g. tutoring, career guidance), and the impact of cohort building, intensive mentoring and active learning on the numbers of TWU STEM majors enrolling in, completing undergraduate degrees and pursuing advanced degrees and careers in STEM fields. The goals of the QuASARS program build on excellent academic enhancement programs on campus (e.g. the Honors Scholars and Bridges to the Baccalaureate programs) and partnerships with academic and industry programs that provide internships and enhanced occupational opportunities for S-STEM scholars and TWU STEM majors, increasing the pool for qualified STEM professionals in Texas and across the nation. The TWU QuASARS S-STEM program is ideally suited to broadly impacting STEM professions in Texas and nationally by increasing the participation of groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM. TWU is the largest university primarily for women in the US and 50% of the undergraduates are members of groups underrepresented in STEM fields. As such, TWU provides an excellent pool of students to increase the representation of these groups in the professional workforce throughout Texas. Funded S-STEM scholars are encouraged to engage in research and experiential opportunities, resulting in broad dissemination of new findings through scholar presentations and publications. Additionally, the TWU S-STEM scholarship program provides networking with existing quality education programs on campus and across Texas, thereby enhancing university and inter-institutional infrastructures.</AbstractNarration>
