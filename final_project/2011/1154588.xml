    <AbstractNarration>Through the "Building a Community of MESA/STEM Scholars Initiative" (MESA stands for Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement), City College of San Francisco (CCSF) is supporting a total of up to 250 scholarships for a diverse group of academically talented, financially needy students across the STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year, CCSF recruits a minimum of 40 students from the CCSF School of Science and Mathematics to apply for the S-STEM scholarship program who are both financially needy and academically talented - and who are representative of the great diversity of CCSF overall. Scholarship participants receive one-on-one academic counseling and participate in cohort-building activities that expose and link them to a wide range of career opportunities and provide them with personal empowerment strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides students access to numerous innovative initiatives in the STEM fields currently in place at CCSF, including cutting-edge programs in biotechnology (such as stem cell technology), computer networking and information technology (including the convergence of optical and network systems), and several others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a community college, CCSF provides one of the most affordable educational options in the San Francisco Bay Area, and through this program it offers extraordinary educational access to STEM students from a broad range of ethnic, economic, cultural, and age backgrounds. Due to its affordability, even a small award substantially relieves CCSF students of financial burdens that often inhibit their academic success.</AbstractNarration>
