    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science Foundation supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site led by Professor Thomas R. Krugh at the University of Rochester. REU students will participate in a 10 week summer program. The primary focus for REU students will be full-time hands-on scientific research as a member of an established research team. Each participant will have a specific research problem, a specific faculty adviser, and a specific mentor to provide day-to-day advice. A weekly REU Group Meeting provides a forum for participants to report their research to each other early in the summer in the form of an oral presentation, and again at the end of the program in a poster presentation and final written report. Participants will learn from each other, and about other areas of chemistry in the oral and poster presentations. They will participate in a variety of social activities, the group will have sessions on careers, they will visit the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, and have a mini-course on entrepreneurship in chemistry. Recruitment of students will give emphasis to the participation of underrepresented minorities, women, and lower division students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates will complete an independent research project, gain an appreciation of life as a graduate student in chemistry, participate in the excitement of discovery, gain in-depth knowledge in their research area, and be exposed to research in other areas through oral presentations and a poster session. The Group Meetings also will be used to discuss graduate education, scientific careers, responsible conduct of research and scientific ethics. Graduate student mentors will experience a valuable learning experience in leadership.</AbstractNarration>
