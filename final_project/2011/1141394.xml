    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The American Society for Plant Biologists (ASPB) will host a Laboratory Leadership Workshop for new and prospective PIs to provide training in skills and approaches required for success in mentoring, networking, research ethics, grant-writing, publication, teaching, and reaching out to the public. The workshop will be held August 4-6, 2011 in Minneapolis, MN just prior to the annual meeting of ASPB. Approximately 20 early-career faculty and 50 postdoctoral scientists are expected to attend. The format of the meeting will be a combination of presentations by invited speakers and discussion among participants. Sessions are aimed at dual-track professional development for those interested in careers in research-intensive institutions and in predominantly undergraduate institutions. Highlights of the workshop will be published in an upcoming ASPB newsletter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The workshop will bring together established investigators and early-career scientists with the aim of providing training in areas not usually encompassed by the traditional route of postdoctoral training. The emphasis on networking will have allow participants to build relationships that will last beyond the workshop itself. Careful attention has been paid to encouraging participation by women and minority scientists, through targeted advertising and availability of travel grants.</AbstractNarration>
