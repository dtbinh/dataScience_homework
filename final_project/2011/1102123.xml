    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the research is to reduce the power consumption of wireless transmitters by improving power amplifier (PA) efficiency. The approach is to use dynamic reconfiguration of power amplifier circuit components in conjunction with sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to ensure that power efficiency does not degrade significantly while generating modulated radio frequency signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research is that it presents a promising, radically different approach that recognizes the need to employ digital signal processing techniques to solve longstanding problems in power amplifier design. Realization of digital signal processing techniques in power amplifier design allows the creation of architectures that operate the power amplifier always in near optimum efficiency mode. The attendant dynamic range limitations are overcome by using signal processing algorithms. The approach is very suitable for monolithic integration in very fine fabrication processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project are at least three fold. First, the research activity addresses the problem of building power efficient wireless transmitters that is crucial to the growth of communication systems in particular and the electronics industry in general. Second, reducing wireless radio power consumption contributes to the growing efforts to lowering our energy footprint. Third, the research activity will be useful in training future circuit designers in the fundamental interplay between circuit design, signal processing, and electromagnetics, thereby preparing them to better face the immediate challenges of circuit design, and to adapt to the impending evolution of integrated circuits from microelectronics into newer technologies.</AbstractNarration>
