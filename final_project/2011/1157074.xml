    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Site activities are integrated into a 10-week summer undergraduate research program in Metallurgical Engineering under a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site themed Back to the Future. Research activities focus on a wide range of important topics in Metallurgical Engineering including alloy development, materials joining, extractive metallurgy, biomaterials, and corrosion engineering. Engineering faculty members have also teamed with faculty in the humanities to provide students with a historic and cultural framework for current research. There is significant evidence that suggests a richer learning environment can be created in engineering by establishing a context within the liberal arts. Students also participate in a number of supplemental workshops in the art and history of metallurgy. The unique supplemental activities of the site contribute to the development of students with different learning styles and have implications for recruiting students from underrepresented groups in engineering and science. Site activities also support student professional development beyond the laboratory, including professional seminars and an integrated technical communications program. Finally, a comprehensive assessment program has been implemented to assess student gains in skills related to research, the impact of the program on students of different typology, and long-term professional development. The research and educational activities are supported by the National Science Foundation, Office of Special Programs, Division of Materials Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation "Back to the Future" Research Experience for Undergraduates Site at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology has been established to expose a diverse group of undergraduate students, including Native American students and women, to the research environment and to help them develop as professionals. The focus of the student research is the study of metals and metal production, an area of vital technological importance to national interest in areas of defense, manufacturing, and energy. Students are also engaged in workshops and activities that underscore the importance of metals throughout history, hence, the 'Back to the Future' theme. This context gives students a broader appreciation for the nature of current and future research as well as the impact of engineering in society. The research and educational activities are supported by the National Science Foundation, Office of Special Programs, Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>
