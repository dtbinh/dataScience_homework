    <AbstractNarration>Research conducted under this grant will address two broad areas in the field of climate dynamics. The first consists of identification and interpretations of the atmospheric variability pattern associated with MJO in terms of variability in thin cirrus clouds, aerosols and geochemical tracers. The second consists of an analysis of time varying patterns of sea surface temperature (SST), sea level pressure (SLP) and surface air temperature over land (SAT) to explore (1) the interrelations between the fields and in particular, the processes that shape the dominant patterns in the SST field, (2) a prominent pattern of wintertime SLP variability, with maximum amplitude over Eurasia, and (3) patterns of SAT and SLP variability whose time-varying indices project upon hemispheric and regional-mean temperatures. The second research area is of interest for understanding recent climate change and determining the anthropogenic contribution to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will have broader impacts through the education of two graduate students. In addition, the work on climate change detection and attribution to anthropogenic or natural causes may benefit decision makers seeking to understand and respond to climate change and its impacts.</AbstractNarration>
