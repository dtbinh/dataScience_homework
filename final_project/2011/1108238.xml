    <AbstractNarration>This planning grant at the University of Wyoming is being used to pilot activities associated with the SkyWatcher project, which is envisioned as a program to use remotely-controlled telescopes for astronomical observing as strategy to intellectually engage a diverse and collaborative group of 13-18 year old Native American and Polynesian students on supported pathways to geoscience careers. In this planning phase, the project team is working with cultural leaders and educators within the Wind River Reservation (Wyoming) and the Hilo Laupahohoe Waiakea School district complex (Hawai'i) to establish products and infrastructure to support cohorts of students engaged in high-tech astronomical research, leveraging more than 100 robotic and remotely controlled telescopes around the world. This first phase is focused on building stronger relationships with the target communities and getting their input on project design details. A leadership team consisting of scientists, educators, local teachers, targeted students, and cultural elders is meeting virtually and face-to-face to develop a plan that is fully reflective of local needs and emphasizes local priorities and mores. Developing scaffolded, inquiry- and social networking-based activities and materials that incorprate sufficient geoscience content within the context of astronomical reserach are being designed. Community-based programs that include star parties and classroom visits are being provided.</AbstractNarration>
