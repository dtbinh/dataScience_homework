    <AbstractNarration>Efficient spectrum sharing among disparate wireless systems without inter-system communication is the central problem in expanding existing and developing future wireless technologies. This proposal explores an integrated physical and network layer approach for spectrum sharing by developing algorithms and protocols that will allow heterogeneous networks to co-exist and maintain required interference constraints. The proposed framework is based on the novel idea of incorporating detailed real-time measurements and prediction of spectrum usage, including traffic parameters and network topology, into the design of cognitive protocols that respond to the actual spectrum occupancy in time, frequency, and space. The following critical enabling technologies of this framework are being developed: (i) identification of non-cooperative spectrally-overlapped transmitters based on location and modulation parameters; (ii) analysis and tracking of spectrum usage based on traffic estimation and prediction; (iii) cognitive co-existence protocols for spectrum sharing with combined traffic and location awareness. The objective of this research is to comprehensively analyze performance gains achieved by exploiting traffic and location awareness while taking into account estimation and prediction errors, physical limitations, and protocol overhead. The research approach is based on a closed loop between theoretical analysis, implementation, and experimental verification on the reconfigurable wireless testbed and network simulation tools. The algorithms, protocols and tools developed by this research will have practical impact on a broad range of wireless systems that share same spectrum resources including: current and future unlicensed bands, vehicular and safety networks, cellular infrastructure and femto cells, emergency and defense networks.</AbstractNarration>
