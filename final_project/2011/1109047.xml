    <AbstractNarration>This project investigates the role of fund flows and fees in portfolio&lt;br/&gt;choice and asset pricing. The main focus is on (i) understanding how&lt;br/&gt;these aspects fit in the existing theory, (ii) developing theoretical&lt;br/&gt;tools that make them tractable, and (iii) evaluating the departures from&lt;br/&gt;classical results due to flows and fees. Central issues are the&lt;br/&gt;extension of duality theory, and the development of asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;techniques in the long-horizon and small-fees limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to incorporate fund flows and fees - two central&lt;br/&gt;aspects of financial intermediation - in mathematical models of&lt;br/&gt;financial markets, to understand their agency effects on asset&lt;br/&gt;allocation, and their implications for welfare and pricing. This project&lt;br/&gt;will help understand the role of financial intermediaries, the&lt;br/&gt;incentives created by their fee-based contracts, and their interaction&lt;br/&gt;with investors' response through flows, that is subscriptions and&lt;br/&gt;redemptions.</AbstractNarration>
