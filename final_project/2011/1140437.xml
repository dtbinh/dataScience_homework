    <AbstractNarration>The Alfred University Calculus Initiative (AUCI) is a multi-faceted project that combines an innovative and distinctive curriculum with classroom transformation, video lessons and examples, online quizzes and homework, and web-based implementation into a comprehensive calculus experience. This project is informed by current research and trends in STEM education, which include engaging students with visual and online technology, creating an active learning environment in the classroom, and incorporating meaningful applications. The AUCI is developing a website from which users can access various course components from remote locations. To take advantage of the intrinsic portability of the course materials, the AUCI is forming partnerships with area school districts so that the course may be offered to high school students on their own campuses and for college credit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental goal of the AUCI is to increase understanding and success in calculus and precalculus while maintaining the level of rigor and breadth required for post-calculus courses. One of the key ideas to achieving AUCI's goal is a fundamental re-ordering of calculus topics. The evaluation of this project focuses on student learning outcomes and success in first-year calculus courses as well as on student perceptions of and attitudes towards the course content and delivery methods. Since each component of the project is adaptable to suit nearly any STEM discipline, the research being conducted on the effects of its content and structure have the potential to be a valuable resource for those interested in new perspectives on teaching calculus and other STEM courses in general.</AbstractNarration>
