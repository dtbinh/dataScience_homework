    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for a 2-day workshop that will bring together a diverse group of scientists and engineers to identify the outstanding fundamental science issues which inhibit broader application of Mg alloys in structural (including biomedical) applications. A renaissance in Mg application and R&amp;D was initiated by the automotive industry, with the primary driver being vehicle mass reduction for improved vehicle efficiency and performance. Interest has expanded into the consumer goods sectors with a large number of manufacturers selecting die cast or thixomolded Mg alloys for the cases of handheld tools and portable electronic goods. Now, the aerospace, defense, and biomedical sectors are all developing interest in developing strategies to exploit the lightest structural metal in the periodic table of elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will provide a forum for approximately 50 researchers from academia, government laboratories, and industry to develop a strategic vision for future research to enable society to benefit from more widespread use of high performance Mg alloys. Approximately 10 invited speakers will present lectures to set the tone for the smaller group discussions. The lecturers will describe recent advances made possible by the application of the most advanced experimental techniques and computational methods. Break-out sessions will address three strategic areas: alloy design &amp; computational modeling, manufacturing &amp; processing, and performance &amp; durability. Fellowships will be issued to a small number of exceptional graduate students, who are interested in academic or research-intensive careers. Finally, an executive summary and comprehensive report will be prepared for the sponsor to document the outcomes of the workshop. The report will also be disseminated via a web site made accessible to workshop participants and others with whom the author and sponsor choose to share it.</AbstractNarration>
