    <AbstractNarration>This research is aimed at developing selective self-powered sensors for the detection of nitroaromatic explosives. Recently, Saint Louis University has developed a biofuel cell that employs mitochondria to catalyze pyruvate oxidation. It is proposed to modify this biofuel cell to be a self-powered sensor for detection of explosives. Mitochondrial function (oxidation of fuel) can be inhibited by the presence of oligomycin, but this inhibition can be selectively uncoupled by low concentrations of nitroaromatic explosives. Therefore, a self-powered sensor that employs oligomycin-treated mitochondria at the anode of a pyruvate powered biofuel cell will be designed. In the absence of explosive, there will be no power generated, but in the presence of explosive, the mitochondria function will be uncoupled and power will be produced as the mitochondria completely oxidize the pyruvate in the fuel compartment of the self-powered sensor. Self-powered sensors would eliminate the need for replacing batteries in sensors and allow for the easier introduction to wireless sensor networks. This research project will also benefit the four high school students each year who will be invited into the laboratory to do research on the project by helping to increase interest in science and develop a better understanding of the research process.</AbstractNarration>
