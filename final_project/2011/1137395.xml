    <AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports Charina Choi of Stanford University as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Choi will work on the synthesis, chemical modification, and study of graphene nanoribbons. The PI will collaborate with scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a better understanding of the electronic properties of graphene nanoribbons, which will help lead to their incorporation into new devices. For her plan for broadening participation, Dr. Choi will develop an annual conference for high school students and teachers from economically-disadvantaged areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr. Choi is aimed at developing a better understanding of the electronic properties of nanoscale ribbons of graphene - an exciting new carbon-based nanomaterial. This is an area of research which shows promise to lead to new kinds of electronic devices, sensors, etc. The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Choi are aimed at educating and empowering young people from groups underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
