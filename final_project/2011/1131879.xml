    <AbstractNarration>This project provides partial support for 8 high school students and 4 adults from St. Paul and St. George, Pribilof Islands, Alaska to attend the Ecosystems Studies of Sub-Arctic Seas (ESSAS) Open Science Meeting (OSM) taking place in May 2011 in Seattle, Washington. The 6 students from Senior or Junior classes will be selected by their teachers to develop a plenary presentation on their on-going studies of the biology and economics of the red king crab industry, one of the main fishing industries in which communities participate. In addition, 2 younger students will present posters of their research on red king crab. The students presentations will be based on over seven years of observations and research on this industry. The 4 adults will be one parent from each community, a teacher, and Dr. Michelle Ridgeway who has been working closely with the schools and their students on this project through a summer science camp where Ridgeway is the science mentor.</AbstractNarration>
