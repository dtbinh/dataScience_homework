    <AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to harvest otherwise wasted mechanical energy and produce renewable electricity with piezoelectric nanomaterials. The approach is focused on the significant factors in the energy conversion at the nanoscale with the development of a 3-dimensional energy harvester, which capitalizes on the significant advantages in material properties and dynamics that nanowires offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The research will lead to greater understanding of energy conversion in piezoelectric zinc oxide and barium titanate nanowires through a 3-dimensional generator based on laterally aligned nanowire arrays. Calculations show that a 3-dimensional generator will produce orders-of-magnitude greater power than current 2-dimensional ones, with potential for piezoelectric materials to function at large scales. This research aims to increase our use of ubiquitous ambient energy sources, such as vibrations in engines, roads, or buildings that are largely wasted today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The integrated research and education plan will synergistically benefit society. Hands-on workshops in a summer camp will inspire interests in science, technology and engineering among K-12 students. The PI?s interdisciplinary research does not require advanced knowledge for students to begin, which will facilitate efforts to recruit underrepresented undergraduate students. The intrigued student can then gain unique experiences by assisting with the proposed research and relevant knowledge through a new course entitled ?Engineered Nanomaterials for Solid-State Energy Conversion?. The research result will be disseminated in leading journals, conferences, and workshops to benefit the scientific community and will be incorporated into the classroom to foster student learning.</AbstractNarration>
