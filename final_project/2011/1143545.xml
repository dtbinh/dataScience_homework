    <AbstractNarration>SABER: Accelerating the emergence of Biology Education Research as a new sub-discipline of Biology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several national reports have called for reforms in undergraduate biology education and instructors have tried a range of pedagogical approaches in the classroom. Are there data on whether these changes improve student learning? Faculty conducting biology education research (BER) focus on rigorous research to assess student learning but they are isolated and fragmented across the sub-disciplines of biology. Through the new network of the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Research (SABER), we propose to create a vibrant community of biology education researchers that will provide the leadership and vision to promote, maintain and guide the scholarly work required to foster and enhance student learning in the biological sciences. The national meeting will be a place where they can meet to exchange ideas, set research agendas, build collaborations and then disseminate those successful strategies that help reform undergraduate biology education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The new network will accelerate the maturation and impact of the new BER sub-discipline, ultimately improving student learning and retention in the biological sciences. Research findings from this new field will document the learning gains associated with pedagogies implemented in the classroom, thereby collecting the data for evidence-based teaching practices and improved learning environments that support the success of a more diverse population of students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The network includes faculty from a range of sub-disciplines, from a range of institutions, and with a range of professional experience. Therefore results of these efforts can have very widespread impact. One goal of the network activities is to better understand how college students learn biology and to develop curricular approaches that will be based on evidence instead of anecdote. This network will benefit current and future undergraduates, particularly underrepresented minorities, who leave the basic and life sciences at a much greater rate than other college disciplines. By advancing our understanding of how best to help students learn biology, we may be able to stem the loss of talent in biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education efforts.</AbstractNarration>
