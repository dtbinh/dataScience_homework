    <AbstractNarration>Scalable Synthesis and Assembly of Novel Ordered Hybrid Nanostructures&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are three-fold: (1) to fabricate novel ordered hybrid nanostructures; (2) to understand the process-structure-property relationship of the novel hybrids; and (3) to test the hypothesis that the novel hybrid nanostructures have great potential for energy storage. The PI plans to investigate a novel scalable process to fabricate such a new nanostructure through a creative combination of chemical synthesis and self-assembly. The process-driven morphology evolution will be explored. Particularly, the processing physics and chemistry will be studied to understand process-structure-property relationship. The hydrogen adsorption and electrochemical characterization of novel hybrids will also be examined to understand the potential for hydrogen and electrical energy storage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will design and fabricate novel nanostructured materials, and significantly advance fundamental knowledge in scalable nanofabrication of new structures for high-efficiency energy storage and lay a foundation for transport and utilization of clean energy. The expected results will provide a fundamental understanding on the relationship between novel nanostructure and bulk properties, and enable a feasible way to bridge the gap between nanoscale building blocks and bulk properties. The results of this project will be broadly disseminated through annual reports, international conferences, and publications in high-profile academic journals.</AbstractNarration>
