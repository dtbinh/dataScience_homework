    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable Energetiq Technology, Inc. to develop and commercialize an advanced Open-Path FTIR Spectrometer (OPFTIR) instrument for monitoring of atmospheric gases over extended distances. The Phase II technical goals will be the optimization of a high-brightness infrared source and optical subsystem that will enable long path instrument capabilities. For current FTIR instruments the infrared light source is a thermal blackbody, limited to operating temperatures of approximately 1000 C. For OP-FTIR instruments the consequences of relying on such low-brightness light sources are (a) bulky and expensive IR optics; (b) expensive IR detectors; and (c) limited monitoring range ? typically less than a few hundred meters. The laser heated IR light source developed in Phase I has demonstrated greater than 2000C operation. Direct comparison with a standard GlobarTM source shows an improvement in signal amplitude of between 2 and 10 (depending on wavelength) and signal to noise measurements imply an improvement in detectability of from 1.5 to about 6. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are in the area of environmental monitoring and potentially in Homeland Security applications. The cost and size of OP-FTIR instruments will be reduced and the range and sensitivity increased. With increased emphasis on monitoring total fluxes of atmospheric pollutants, including global warming gases such as CO2, OP-FTIR instruments will be even more widely used in the future.</AbstractNarration>
