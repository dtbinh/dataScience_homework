    <AbstractNarration>This award provides $25K funding per year for three years for a PI and co-PI to provide staff support to a Roundtable on Technology, Science, and Peacebuilding. The roundtable will convene individuals from government, industry, and non- governmental organizations to identify opportunities for the use of science, engineering, and technology to enhance peacebuilding. The roundtable will facilitate a collaborative effort to address major challenges giving rise to global conflict and to apply appropriate science and engineering knowledge and technologies to specific problems in conflict zones.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: By applying science and engineering knowledge and technology to major issues that give rise to international conflict, such as natural resource scarcity, this award may have a significant impact. A sizeable portion of the world population lives in areas of conflict or potential conflict. The roundtable also provides an innovative model for education and outreach for the next generation science, engineering, and technology workforce.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The roundtable brings together experts in foreign policy, peacebuilding, business, and science, engineering, and technology research. This promotes understanding of the complex issues giving rise to global conflict and of potential strategies for addressing them. It also facilitates broad-based public-private partnerships that enhance the impact of NSF-funded research in addressing societal problems and promoting innovation.</AbstractNarration>
