    <AbstractNarration>A regional partnership of technical colleges and universities, workforce investment boards, K-12 systems, and water-driven industries and businesses have identified gaps to be filled to meet the specific personnel and skill needs of southeastern Wisconsin's water technology businesses and emerging occupations. This ATE project - H2Options - is filling these gaps by modifying and developing new associate degree and technical certificate water technology programs, and establishing high school and university articulations as a part of pathways to water technology careers. This project is promoting the training of new water industry technicians to meet the growing workforce demands of the water industry in southeastern Wisconsin. These degrees and certificates are serving students at the partner institutions, as well as incumbent and dislocated workers. Through articulation, regional high school students are being introduced to opportunities in water technology and gain basic competencies to transition into two- and four-year programs. Students also benefit from internships, service learning, and mentoring opportunities. The H2Options program identifies new articulation areas; expands knowledge of specific skills, tasks and technology needed in water technology sectors; develops networks and partnerships; and makes the expanded curriculum for the career pathways available nationally. The broader impacts of the project include the modification of at least one associate degree program and creation of four new certificate programs that will reach a wide range of persons in southeastern Wisconsin. In addition, the project promotes new AAS to BS transfer articulations, incumbent worker promotional opportunities, and adult and youth career pathways leading to water industry employment through internship and service learning programs.</AbstractNarration>
