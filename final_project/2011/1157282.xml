    <AbstractNarration>Major Research Initiative in Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology: Production of a Science Plan&lt;br/&gt;Judith Parrish-Jones, University of Idaho&lt;br/&gt;EAR-1157282&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last three decades, scientists who study the Earth?s sedimentary crust and the history of life have conducted innumerable workshops and produced dozens of white papers outlining critical research opportunities in the disciplines. This community may represent the most integrative part of the earth sciences. The community addresses issues of the history of life on Earth and the dynamics of evolution and extinction, the history of climate and climate dynamics, and the history of sedimentation and the dynamics of sedimentary basins. The entire record of climate and life is preserved in sedimentary rocks, and is understood through integrated studies of tectonics, climate, life, and sedimentology. Our sample of modern processes is limited, yet understanding of these processes is important to many societal concerns. Fundamental knowledge about these processes is recorded in the sedimentary record. Without understanding the full range of process behavior we do not truly understand processes such as climate change, extinction, and resource distribution and quality. This workshop will integrate research opportunities identified by the community over the last several years in order to provide a framework for moving forward with major research initiatives. This workshop will be held in Arlington, Virginia at Marymount College on October 24 and 25th, 2011.</AbstractNarration>
