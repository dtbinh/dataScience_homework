    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate that 840 nm spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) can provide images equal to or better than those currently available from swept source OCT, with the added advantages of higher imaging speeds and lower cost. Intravascular OCT is poised for commercial growth, but is still limited by technical complexity, availability, and cost. This Phase I SBIR proposes a complete prototype system based on a very high resolution (0.02 nm/pixel) spectrometer, capable of imaging 5 mm deep with a resolution of &lt; 10 microns. A novel fiber probe will be designed and prototyped. Proof of principle data will be collected from tissue phantoms and waste animal tissue. Pending successful completion of a Phase I, a Phase II project would complete system engineering, decrease system cost, and target first in-human imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is an increase in performance and availability of intravascular OCT (IV-OCT). Intravascular OCT provides detailed imaging information for plaque assessment, stent implantation, and stent monitoring over time. Identification and treatment of unstable plaques and other intravascular conditions can reduce the morbidity and mortality rate from coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is the primary cause of heart attacks and strokes, which killed over 631,000 and 137,000 people, respectively, in the U.S in 2006. The market size for intravascular OCT is estimated at more than $1B annually, but there is currently only one commercially available IV-OCT system. By increasing system speed and reducing cost, this project will accelerate clinical use of IV-OCT.</AbstractNarration>
