    <AbstractNarration>This research initiation grant in engineering education project seeks to answer the question of how technology impacts learning in engineering classrooms. While technology is often assumed to lead to increased learning, it can be expensive for institutions and/or students and thus research is needed to help determine when such investment is most valuable. The collaboration between engineering faculty and psychology researchers this award supports will help to determine whether it is the technology that impacts learning, or other factors that may be replicable at lower cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to investigate how technology impacts a classroom culture, thus informing decisions by universities whether investments in technology are wise for given learning outcomes. The project specifically focuses on women and disabled students who are under-represented in engineering. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>
