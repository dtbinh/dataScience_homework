    <AbstractNarration>Bioinformatics and systems biology are complementary disciplines that hold great promise for the advancement of research and development in complex biomedical systems, agricultural, environmental, pharmaceutical and medical sciences as well as public health, drug design, genomics and other similar areas. Research and development in these two disciplines impact the science and technology of fields such as medicine, food production, forensics, agriculture, pharmacology, engineering and bio-mathematical and biophysical sciences, among others. This impact is accomplished by advancing fundamental concepts in molecular biology, genomics and medicine, helping us understand living organisms at multiple levels, developing innovative implants and prosthetics, creating new medical image technologies, and improving tools and techniques for the detection, prevention and treatment of diseases. The International Joint Conference on Bioinformatics, Systems Biology and Intelligent Computing (IJCBS) 2011 provides a common platform for the cross fertilization of ideas and will help shape knowledge and scientific achievements by bridging these two very important and complementary disciplines into an interactive and attractive forum. Keeping this objective in mind, IJCBS 2011 is aimed at promoting interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary education and research, especially for underrepresented groups such as women, minorities, and students with disabilities, as well as faculty, engineers and scientists in these broad but very important scientific fields. The IJCBS 2011 will provide travel support to those under-represented groups and support distinguished workshops and keynote and tutorial lectures delivered by the world's top scientists in their fields. The IJCBS 2011 will host these special sessions focusing on interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary education and research in order to foster collaboration between the bioinformatics and systems biology domains. The IJCBS 2011 is markedly a large flagship international conference in these fields, seeking long term collaborations at the emerging interface.</AbstractNarration>
