    <AbstractNarration>Project Abstract: The purpose of this award is to support four new Satellite Educational Workshops that will be held concurrently before the start of the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities annual meeting (Orlando FL, March 2012). The four workshops are (1) Pathway Analysis in Transcriptomics, Proteomics and Metabolomics; (2) Business Skills for Core Facility Directors and Managers; 3) Epigenomics: Design, Implementation and Analysis of RNA-seq and Methyl-seq Experiments; and (4) Manual Interpretation of Electron Transfer Dissociation Mass Spectra of Peptides. The award will enable the establishment of a Travel Award program dedicated to the professional development of core facility personnel and of young scientists interested in life science technologies. This NSF award will help establish online educational materials for workshop participants and provide the foundation for the development of future shared educational resources for the community at large. The intellectual merit of these workshops is in educating the constant flow of new, enthusiastic researchers in the use of both established and cutting-edge technologies critical to the progression of science in all fields. The broader impact of this award is to provide a particularly powerful mechanism for facilitating the participation of individuals from underrepresented groups, including women and members of minority groups, who would not otherwise be able to afford to attend the educational satellite workshops.</AbstractNarration>
