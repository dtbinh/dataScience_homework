    <AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to bridge engineering and natural sciences in an inter-disciplinary collaboration, which will enhance course instruction and research projects across disciplines. The approach is to acquire a state-of-art biopotential instrumentation system that allows the PIs to enhance their collaboration in more advanced research projects with students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the proposal is centered on enhancing a facility that will foster the interaction between the faculty and students in science and engineering to plan and conduct research. This interaction will allow its members to work as a team of scientists and engineers across disciplines, and to interpret and communicate research findings in both peer-reviewed journal publications and at national conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts will be to effectively integrate education and research; enhance scientific and technical understanding, and engage in research that can benefit society. The outcome of this research is aimed at developing new devices and/or new treatments to improve the quality of life of individuals suffering from neurological disorders. This collaboration is being conducted by under-represented minorities at different stages of professional development, who have demonstrated a track record of engaging under-represented minority students in research in the natural sciences and engineering. This equipment will be utilized to continue improving the research projects from their successful collaborations and allow students to conduct research and independent study projects. Through a data-sharing plan, peer-institutions will be able to access the data collected with this equipment for other projects.</AbstractNarration>
