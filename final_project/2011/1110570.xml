    <AbstractNarration>A fundamental problem in ecology is to understand how a large number of similar species are able to coexist in the same community. This project will explore the role of thermal physiology in facilitating habitat partitioning by multiple species. The study organisms are 18 species of tropical lizard in the genus Anolis. As a generality, anoles tend to prefer either cool, shaded areas or hot, open areas. It is predicted that, in cold-blooded animals such as lizards, species that live in cool areas should have high physiological performance at low temperatures, whereas species that inhabit warm areas should have high physiological performance at high temperatures. Support for this prediction is mixed. This study will measure the temperature-dependence of sprint performance, a physiological trait important for lizard survival. Lizards of each species will be collected and run at multiple temperatures and their temperature-dependent physiological performances will be compared. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In order for species to coexist, each species must occupy a different niche. However, our understanding of the adaptations that promote niche differences and thus species coexistence are far from complete. This project seeks to understand these adaptations, as the lizards being studied co-occur in complex biological communities. In addition, the project will provide critical information essential for developing successful management plans to maintain biological diversity under predicted conditions of global change. This project will also provide an opportunity for undergraduates to become actively involved on multiple aspects of the research process.</AbstractNarration>
