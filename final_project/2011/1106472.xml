    <AbstractNarration>In the past, speech research training was only available to students and researchers associated with major research universities and large centers where dedicated software development was joined with mentoring and expert technical support. In the current environment, inexpensive computers, electronic distance communication, and specialist freeware, have expanded the opportunities for dissemination of research and knowledge outside of such large centers. On the one hand, this is an exciting development, because it reduces barriers to entry for a wider and more diverse set of students and researchers. On the other, hand, the laboratory software for visualizing and manipulating acoustic signals is either prohibitively expensive for institutions to buy, or else discouragingly inefficient for students at introductory levels. Other software is easy to use but doesn't teach the fundamental scientific principles that underlie the manipulations allowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to meet this opportunity for expanded access, this award supports a conference workshop, "Software To Empower Learning And Research In Speech (STELARIS)," for scientists, students and software developers. The theme of the workshop is to identify the best existing platforms and develop standards for future developments that minimize technical barriers to data exchange, while maximizing use as a teaching and research tool.</AbstractNarration>
