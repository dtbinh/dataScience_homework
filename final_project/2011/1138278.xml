    <AbstractNarration>The Analytical and Surface Chemistry program in the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Sylvia Daunert of the University of Kentucky. The research program of Prof. Daunert focuses on the development of whole-cell sensing systems. Whole-cell sensing systems are ideal analytical tools in biomedical analysis as well as in environmental monitoring due to their sensitivity, selectivity, and rapidity. Their potential would further be enhanced if they could be used effectively for on-site applications. In that regard, there is a need for methods that improve the shelf-life and transportability of whole-cell biosensing systems, and allow for their adaptation to miniaturized systems for field analysis. To that end, Prof. Daunert and her students will develop a method based on the use of bacterial spores for the long-term maintenance of the viability and activity of bacterial sensing cells, and integrate such preserved sensor cells into portable systems for on-site sensing. Bacterial spores were chosen as the protective component of whole-cell sensors since they are a resting form of life that exhibit long-term resistance towards extreme environmental conditions, and are able to resume full metabolic activity when properly stimulated. Specifically, Prof. Daunert and her students will develop genetically engineered whole-cell sensing systems for various target analytes using spore-forming bacteria. They will then produce spores as means of preservation, storage and transport of the sensing cells. Subsequently, they will incorporate these dormant sensors into a miniaturized compact disk-like microfluidic platform. Additionally, they will immobilize them on paper strips as a simple ready-to-use configuration. Both systems can be transported to the field, where the spores can be germinated to vegetative cells and employed for sensing. Prof. Daunert envisions that this new strategy could expand the use of whole-cell biosensors for on-site analysis, not only in mild environments, but also in environments and applications in which they could not be employed previously. These include extreme environments, such as deserts, polar regions and space, as well as the remote sensing of chemical warfare agents used for bioterrorism. The impact of this work could be strong in developing countries, where rapid, simple and inexpensive analytical tools for monitoring human health and the environment are needed, and limitations are often posed by unfavorable climate conditions and inadequate distribution and storage facilities. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to students in a cutting edge multidisciplinary research area of high societal impact.</AbstractNarration>
