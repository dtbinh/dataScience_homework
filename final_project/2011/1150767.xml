    <AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports research to explore novel mechanisms for highly efficient assembly of rotary nano-electromechanical devices (NEMS motors or nanomotors) from nanocale building blocks and to elucidate the fundamental nanoscale interactions in such systems. Rotary nanomotors, a type of NEMS device, are particularly important for advancing NEMS technology. However, the complexity of top-down fabrication of miniature motors has greatly hindered their development for practical applications. In this research, the PI aims to investigate an innovative mechanism to (1) successfully assemble and accurate large arrays of nanomotors consisting of nanowires as rotors, nanomagnets as bearings, and quadruple microelectrodes as stators; (2) investigate the nanoscale interactions involved in a nanomotor system for high-performance nanomotors with controlled rotation angle, speed and chirality, like stepper motors; (3) evaluate and experimentally investigate the size limits of nanomotors; and (4) demonstrate the synergistic operation of nanomotors for pumping nanoparticles and biological cells in microfluidics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will result in a unique bottom-up assembly scheme for rotary NEMS devices that can be integrated into large arrays to perform complex functions. The assembly concept using nanoscale building blocks can provide a practical solution for the economical production of NEMS devices. The research may also advance our understanding of fundamental nanoscale electrical-material-mechanical-magnetic interactions. Overall, the proposed research may produce transformative impacts on multiple fields including NEMS, microfluidics, and lab-on-chip architectures. The synergy of research and education will benefit graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students, increase participation of minorities and women, bring new perspectives on nano-assembly and applications to classroom teaching, and result in the development of a Nanomotor Learning Module for demonstration at the Austin Children's Museum.</AbstractNarration>
