    <AbstractNarration>The Association for Institutional Research (AIR) proposes a two-year continuation of a program that has increased the capacity of the postsecondary education community to use nationally representative sample surveys and other National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) datasets, thereby improving the quality of information underlying decision making in postsecondary education, and the effectiveness of those decisions. The proposed program has three components that will 1) support new research initiatives, 2) support dissemination of findings, and 3) provide face-to-face training in the use of national databases. These components are targeted to institutional researchers, faculty, and doctoral students who conduct research about American postsecondary education including trends in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)- and who use national data to inform campus and national higher education practices.</AbstractNarration>
