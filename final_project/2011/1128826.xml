    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop a method for integrating design and power management of a regional system for deployment of plug-in electric vehicle charging stations, each of which obtains power from wind, solar and the grid. The method embodies a two-stage algorithm, the first stage handles system design, and the second stage handles dynamic control under uncertainty. The second stage control problem is embedded within the first stage design problem, thus enabling design for controllability. The solution procedure uses a new, statistically parsimonious algorithm to reduce the computational demands that have previously made this problem intractable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This research is foundational to energy system development, an area of critical national need. Success in addressing the foundational issues will demonstrate the efficacy of the method for the design and deployment of realistic systems and help identify questions worthy of further investigation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This work has the potential of improving the penetration level of renewable energy and ease or delay the need for infrastructure improvement. Design for controllability is critical for many other complex systems in energy, transportation, telecommunications, sustainability, manufacturing, health care, etc. The team has a track record of educating members of under-represented groups and will continue to do so. Research results will be disseminated via standard academic means and will be shared with Vision North Texas, a public-private partnership seeking a more sustainable future for North Central Texas.</AbstractNarration>
