    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The proposed program will develop nanowire transistors for low-noise operation, which has not been addressed extensively to date in most material systems. The proposed work will focus on core/shell nanowire structures, which have the potential to provide well-controlled interfaces comparable to those which have enabled high-performance heterostructures devices in a number of materials. This well-integrated effort will correlate the device performance to the materials, structure and bias conditions of the devices, and will provide a means to utilize the measured noise characteristics to understand the overall conduction processes within the devices.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed research would provide new device concepts and new insights for technologically relevant developments in nanowire-based electronics, including applications in RF circuitry. The study will explore an approach which could be broadly applied to a number of semiconductor materials of interest for various device applications. The proposed effort also includes an integrated education and outreach program aimed at addressing challenges in nanotechnology-related education/training arising from the interdisciplinary nature of many of the projects, and aimed at providing opportunities for participants from under-represented groups. The proposed education and outreach program builds from programs which address the specific challenges arising from this interdisciplinary area. The proposed program includes development of a 1-D Nanoelectronics course and integrated research and professional development experiences for undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
