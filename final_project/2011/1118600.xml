    <AbstractNarration>Curricular materials for undergraduate education in chemical measurement and instrumentation science are being developed and implemented by faculty members at 20 public and private doctoral-granting, predominantly undergraduate, and minority-serving institutions. This includes three historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and one hispanic-serving institution (HIS). The materials are inquiry- and problem-based modules on measurement techniques and methods. Integrative contextual modules that use measurement techniques and methods in the context of a larger scientific question or problem are being developed as well. Modules are designed to be used in a variety of formats (e.g., classroom activity, homework assignment, laboratory project) and modified to suit the particular needs of an instructor or institution. Many of the materials are designed to be undertaken by students working interactively in small groups. Faculty teaching expertise and student-learning outcomes are being expanded and improved at the institutions involved in this project. Over 900 students a year benefit by developing their ability to solve problems, work independently, and think critically. A workshop is being offered for faculty members at HBCUs and HSIs to develop faculty expertise in the use of the inquiry-based electronic resources and promote the utilization of the materials outside the project development team. The materials developed in this project are being disseminated through the NSF-funded Analytical Sciences Digital Library (ASDL), http://www.asdlib.org/, an open-access, peer-reviewed and annotated collection of electronic resources on chemical measurements and instrumentation for students, instructors, and practitioners of the analytical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
