    <AbstractNarration>The American Society of Plant Biologists is instituting a workshop, to be held at their annual meeting in August of 2011, in order to discuss and formulate plans for the society to respond to an NSF funded report from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Vision and Change (V&amp;C) in Undergraduate Education, A Call to Action (scheduled for release February 19). The workshop will engage 200 conferees representing a wide spectrum of institutional types (from community colleges to R1 universities) and plant biology interests (from plant molecular biology and genomics to those interested in ecological interactions between populations). Special efforts are being made to attract faculty from the tribal colleges in the area. The workshop is also being planned to serve as a starting point for identifying: resources for responding to V&amp;C recommendations, gaps in those resources, opportunities to disseminate existing resources, and opportunities to develop new resources to address identified gaps.</AbstractNarration>
