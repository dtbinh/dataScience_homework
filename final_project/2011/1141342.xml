    <AbstractNarration>SRI and its partners, the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) and the Universidad &lt;br/&gt;Metropolitana (UMET), collectively the Arecibo Managing Partners (AMP), will provide on-site staff at &lt;br/&gt;Arecibo during the transition period and will cooperate fully with the present Cornell University &lt;br/&gt;management team to ensure a graceful transition, including: continuity of the scientific observation &lt;br/&gt;program; seamless operation of the Education and Public Outreach (EPO) program; clear, fair, and timely &lt;br/&gt;transition of employee compensation and benefits; stewardship of maintenance, safety, and &lt;br/&gt;environmental duties; efficient initiation of new business systems; and, importantly, &lt;br/&gt;resolving uncertainties of the incumbent staff, user communities, and other stakeholders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Transition Plan is divided into two overlapping phases to ensure that all necessary functions are &lt;br/&gt;completed in a timely manner and with minimal impact on AO operations. The first phase covers the &lt;br/&gt;formal four-month transfer period while the second is an ongoing process of integration and adjustment, &lt;br/&gt;which will continue throughout the first year of the new Cooperative Agreement. An important feature of &lt;br/&gt;the transition process is the immediate appointment and relocation of the Director-designate/PI as the on- &lt;br/&gt;site transition manager to provide clear responsibility and accountability for transition implementation,&lt;br/&gt;and collaborative alignment with the incumbent, NSF, NASA, and the staff.</AbstractNarration>
