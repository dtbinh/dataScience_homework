    <AbstractNarration>This project is to increase the number of talented, recent high school graduates successfully completing the mechatronics engineering, mechanical engineering technology and electronic engineering technology baccalaureate degree programs at Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology. The objectives are: 1) to provide 25 four-year scholarships to talented, economically disadvantaged students enrolled in Vaughn's programs; 2) to improve student support services by providing scholarship recipients with a centralized hub of academic support services including: highly qualified tutors, mentors, supplemental instructors and academic advisors - all located in Vaughn's Teaching and Learning Center; 3) to increase the number of students who complete undergraduate research projects under the mentorship of Vaughn faculty; 4). to increase the number of engineering and engineering technologies scholarship recipients securing internships with local companies. The project includes a number of interventions to achieving its objectives, including tutoring, mentoring, industry internships, and a Technology Day Conference. The project will have a positive impact on the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields, particularly Hispanic Americans. The partnerships with industry and other organizations that include United Technologies Corporation, Delta Airlines, and the Federal Aviation Administration will help to broaden the impact.</AbstractNarration>
