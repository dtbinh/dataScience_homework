    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Mark Watson of the University of Kentucky will explore the role of side chain structure in the assembly and conducting properties of conjugated polymers. The approach is to prepare three classes of donor-acceptor copolymers possessing unique repeat units: (1) donor monomers carrying alkoxy side chains with increasingly bulky branches placed at the alpha- and beta-positions from the polymer backbone; (2) donor monomers carrying alkynyl side chains with increasingly bulky branches placed at the 3- and 4-positions; (3) acceptor monomers with side chains positioned perpendicular to the polymer backbone. Structure-property relationships in the synthesized polymers will be delineated using a series of characterization methods. The broader impacts involve training undergraduate and graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment, broadening participation of underrepresented groups in chemical sciences via visits to regional institutions to present hands-on science demonstrations and participation in week-long "Summer Science Camps" and a local children's museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastics are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices. Electrically conducting carbon-based (organic) molecules and polymers hold enormous promise for realizing highly efficient, affordable, and broadly available electronic and optical devices. This research explores how the structure of the polymer affects its assembly which, in turn, impacts its properties and performance in electronic devices. Ultimately, such work could lead to the development of organic electronic materials, low cost solar cells, light emitting displays, and chemical and biological sensors.</AbstractNarration>
