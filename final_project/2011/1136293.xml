    <AbstractNarration>The TigersTeach Noyce Initiative is a partnership involving Clemson's Eugene T. Moore School of Education, College of Engineering and Science, and College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences in collaboration with partner school districts in Anderson, Oconee, Pickens and Greenville Counties, SC. The project is providing scholarships for 30 undergraduates or post-baccalaureate students to become mathematics and science teachers. Teacher candidates participate in early field experiences guided by Master Teachers. The project provides multiple entry points for students from first-year engineering and science majors through post-baccalaureate students. Students either enter a dual degree program completing a degree in a STEM major plus a STEM education degree or enter a graduate level MAT program in secondary science or mathematics after completing a STEM undergraduate degree. The project uses a servant-leader model focusing on a commitment of service to high-needs communities and providing substantive immersive experiences in school and community agencies. Using Clemson University's innovative Call Me Mister program as a model, the project is creating a comprehensive set of activities to develop a program with service and leadership as intended outcomes, both on campus and in partner schools. These program activities educate students about the teaching profession by involving them in seminars with veteran scientists and teachers, by encouraging participation in professional conferences, and by working in local schools and agencies. Students learn about and contribute back to the community and profession by being engaged in a continuous series of mentoring, tutoring, and teaching events throughout the program.</AbstractNarration>
