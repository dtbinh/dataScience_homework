    <AbstractNarration>A mobile health monitoring system generates and monitors data related to a patient?s health using a wireless or wired channel. It may also control dosages of medicine or alter the behavior of medical devices to preserve a patient?s health. Such continuous monitoring and control gives mobile health monitoring systems the promise of improving health for lower costs than traditional methods. The security of mobile health monitoring systems is critical because of the importance of their tasks and the vulnerability of the devices and their operating environments. Such devices are sometimes used in hospitals or other health care facilities, but more often in patients? homes, offices, and other ordinary environments whose physical and cyber security cannot be controlled. The security of widely used mobile health monitoring devices is badly flawed. This danger will be addressed by adding security mechanisms to the overall system and environment in which mobile medical health devices operate. While less effective and efficient than designing such devices properly in the first place, there are reasonable low-cost solutions that can substantially improve the safety and security of such devices.</AbstractNarration>
