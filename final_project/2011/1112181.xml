    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Timothy Hanusa of the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University will explore the relationships between early main-group elements and the lanthanide (rare earth) metals. This study will help establish the extent to which inexpensive and abundant early main group metals such as calcium, strontium, and barium can supplement or substitute for the increasingly expensive rare earth elements, which are of enormous importance to modern society. Multidentate ligands with unconventional bridges such as phosphonium groups will be designed so that the metals can be placed in coordination environments that will compensate for differences in oxidation states. Their structures and reactions with polar molecules can then be studied both experimentally and computationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the relationship between the rare earth metals and comparable main group elements is clarified, this research could lead to new uses of the latter in organic transformations and catalysis. Such reactions are potentially broadly applicable in the chemical and polymer industries, especially where inexpensive and non-toxic reagents are required. Furthermore, the proposed research involves the professional training of students, both in instruction in research skills, and in oral and written communications of their findings. In addition, educational efforts are being directed at broadening the participation of women and members of tradtionally underrepresented groups in chemistry and at reaching out to both middle and high school students.</AbstractNarration>
