    <AbstractNarration>The increasing numbers of overweight and obese adolescents is a key health challenge in 21st century&lt;br/&gt;America. Since the 1980s, rates of overweight adolescents have doubled, and rates of obese adolescents&lt;br/&gt;have tripled; adolescent obesity is now the single biggest predictor of adult obesity. At the same time,&lt;br/&gt;adolescents are spending increasing portions of their lives interacting with video games and social&lt;br/&gt;network sites, incorporating computing into their leisure and social communication practices on a large&lt;br/&gt;scale. This project uses computing technology to address adolescent obesity through the&lt;br/&gt;development and study of social tools to promote sustained everyday healthy practices by adolescents.&lt;br/&gt;The research demonstrates how social computing&lt;br/&gt;can enable offline healthy behaviors, using peers as motivators in contrast to "top-down"&lt;br/&gt;approaches. The work is in partnership with DeKalb County Schools, Georgia's&lt;br/&gt;most urban school district and a leading awardee of research-focused programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in this project is exploring the effects of various social computing&lt;br/&gt;tools and features on a set of validated outcome measures grounded in our previous work and best&lt;br/&gt;practices. During the school year the project deploys a series of pedometer-based social health&lt;br/&gt;applications and games for 8th graders in two middle schools. In the summers between deployment cycles, a small subset of participants takes part in design sessions for the next school year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research focuses on three main topics:&lt;br/&gt;1. The role of online social identity presentation in intrinsic motivation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The ability of social computing interventions to facilitate offline rituals and habits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The impact of collective experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to our understanding of the connections between social&lt;br/&gt;media activity and offline behavior. It will also demonstrate improvements in health behaviors and attitudes for adolescents. Moreover by deepening the connection between the&lt;br/&gt;Dekalb School System in Atlanta and Georgia Tech, the project enriches the educational environment&lt;br/&gt;of these middle school students.</AbstractNarration>
