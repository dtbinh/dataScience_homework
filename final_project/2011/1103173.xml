    <AbstractNarration>This BioTEKS project is designed to prepare biotechnology laboratory technicians with the skills needed to be successful employees in plant and animal research laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The need for this program was established with the assistance of Manhattan Chamber of Commerce and KansasBIO. The objectives of the project are to: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Adapt traditional biotechnician coursework for delivery in a blended format through a postsecondary collaborative model; &lt;br/&gt;(2) Develop and facilitate professional development for instructors from partner institutions to orient them to the laboratory portions of the biotechnology curriculum as well as for new faculty transitioning from industry to teaching; and &lt;br/&gt;(3) Create a handbook on Guidelines for Effective Collaboration document based on research of best practices and institutional experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The BioTEKS project is: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Providing new opportunities for training to students in a high wage, high demand field and providing an innovative education model that can be replicated. &lt;br/&gt;(2) Adapting effective curriculum models developed and used by other technical and community colleges. &lt;br/&gt;(3) Using a blended instructional model that engages students and provides scheduling flexibility.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Involving industry in developing training that meets specific competencies and workplace needs. &lt;br/&gt;(5) Disseminating a blended instruction collaborative model and the handbook via presentations, conferences, workshops, and symposia, and publication in a variety of media.</AbstractNarration>
