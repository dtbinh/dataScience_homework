    <AbstractNarration>In many areas of science and engineering differential equations are employed as&lt;br/&gt;models of complex phenomena. The focus in this proposal is on the approximation&lt;br/&gt;of solutions of infinite dimensional dynamical systems. In particular, the investigator&lt;br/&gt;and his colleagues are interested in understanding the dynamics of the finite dimensional &lt;br/&gt;approximations and how they relate to the dynamics of the original dynamical system. &lt;br/&gt;The specific issues to be investigated are related to stability of solutions of spatially &lt;br/&gt;discrete reaction-diffusion equations, the dynamics of so-called anti-diffusion lattice &lt;br/&gt;differential equations, dynamics and computation of traveling waves for neutral mixed &lt;br/&gt;type functional differential equations and rigorous computation of periodic orbits &lt;br/&gt;for retarded delay equations, robust stability for time dependent linear Hamiltonian systems, &lt;br/&gt;numerical techniques for efficient computation of Lyapunov exponent like quantities based &lt;br/&gt;upon nonlinear flows, and approximation techniques for stability spectra of delay equations &lt;br/&gt;and partial differential equations. Techniques to investigate these systems combine &lt;br/&gt;numerical analysis and dynamical systems ideas to gain a better understanding of &lt;br/&gt;approximation dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Often in complex systems the differential equations used in modeling are infinite &lt;br/&gt;dimensional, but necessarily these models are approximated by finite dimensional &lt;br/&gt;systems in order to perform numerical simulations. In order to understand the behavior of &lt;br/&gt;these models, the investigator and his colleagues are interested in similarities &lt;br/&gt;and differences in the behavior of the original infinite dimensional system and &lt;br/&gt;finite dimensional approximations, for example those obtained through discretization. &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the impact of discretization leads to greater confidence when &lt;br/&gt;making inferences from simulation results. In addition, stability analysis is useful &lt;br/&gt;in understanding the robustness of complex biological phenomena that occur in the &lt;br/&gt;environment and in identifying instabilities, for example, in models of weather prediction. &lt;br/&gt;Discrete models of both biological and physical processes are becoming more important as &lt;br/&gt;the need for detailed, microscopic models increases and should benefit from improved &lt;br/&gt;analysis and computational capabilities.</AbstractNarration>
