    <AbstractNarration>Some unknown physical and chemical phenomena can be precisely observed and engineered by manipulating fluids in micro and nano scales. PI?s long-term research agenda lies in the development of Integrated Microsystems to enable such interface and reverse-engineering on non-electric ambient phenomena by utilizing precision electro-mechanical transduction via fluidic movement. This 5-year CAREER proposal focuses on developing a ?wearable? micro gas chromatography (Ã¬GC) system to enable real-time, on-spot, and personal monitoring of a class of various airborne pollutants (Volatile Organic Compounds: VOCs) for early warning for individuals. Specifically, PI proposes to investigate fundamental sciences of an entirely novel gas chromatography configuration that is expected to overcome the major barrier in miniaturization and enable the ultra-high capacity, selectivity, and portability beyond the current state-of-the-art technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To overcome the miniaturization barrier in scaled-down gas chromatography devices, the fundamental scientific conflict has to be resolved between the capacities of chromatographic separation and fluidic pumping under size restriction. Gas chromatography systems identify targets by racing them along a column resulting in spatial separation. Ideally a longer column provides farther isolation among more targets and thus higher detection capacity. However, it imposes rapidly-increasing fluidic resistance that requires over-sized pumps preventing true portability of the whole system. Therefore, in order to enable both high-capacity and wearable-portability in GCs, both the sufficient column length and fluidic head pressure should be attained in a miniaturized size. Currently there are no viable options to achieve both. This project proposes to address such barriers by: (1) investigating fundamental sciences and establishing a prediction model of the proposed novel gas chromatography configuration, (2) examining and maximizing performance capacity and limitation under scaling, and (3) experimentally demonstrating functioning GC operation utilizing the novel configuration for environmental monitoring: detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Although holding great promises as an enabling tool, recent micro-scale gas sensors still require bulky pumping systems barring true portability of the whole integrated system. This project obviates such dilemma by providing a novel paradigm-shifting concept in gas-chromatography-based sensors. Scientific establishment of the proposed concept is expected to lead to a revolutionary advancement in generic chemical and biological detection technology and instrumentation in all scales. Additionally, the experimental demonstration will provide a new design guideline for the multiple-component gas chromatography system with the new configurations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Recent literature and government policy have increasingly reported the emerging demands of knowing environmental conditions in real-time at workplace, public, and home. The proposed project is expected to bring MicroSystems technology, analytical chemistry, and environmental education together creating synergetic impacts in increasing the environmental awareness in both academia and public. Specifically, the education objective of this project is to enhance the awareness of under-represented highschool and K-12 students of the importance in environmental monitoring and the roles of science and technology. This project will educate the next-generation students with the impacts of the micro/nano sensor technology in such a context. This project will train multiple graduate and undergraduate students through a new course and hands-on modules, and many K-12 students to the basic sensor concepts through on-going collaboration with a local science museum. This project is highly inter-disciplinary among engineering and science, and will also expose students to important social issues for balanced education.</AbstractNarration>
