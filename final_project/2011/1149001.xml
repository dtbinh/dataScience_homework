    <AbstractNarration>This project enhances the research direction of the interdisciplinary arts-engineering Media Arts &amp; Technology (MAT) doctoral program at UC Santa Barbara, through the introduction of a practice-based, study in visually applied robotics. The ultimate challenge in any arts, science and engineering collaboration is a convincing articulation as to why and how artistic contribution can be of benefit to the scientific and engineering research. We propose to develop a prototype multi-camera instrument consisting of three robotically actuated cameras for experiments in content recognition and image stabilization of real-time noisy images generated by the moving cameras which try to synchronize their visual content. Our project?s purpose is to develop new solutions in image synchronization through the study of images generated by machine behavior, bridging knowledge perspectives from visualization experts from the two fields of arts and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the iterative working process of experimental staging and evaluation of results, we plan to identify and formally define methodology similarities and differences by which artists and engineers arrive at solutions. We are therefore interested in closely examining problem-solving at the implicit and explicit levels. Our project?s principal objectives are to: a) To develop an instrument of an exploratory, experimental nature that will be used in multiple ways to stimulate advances in research dealing with the optical-mechanical robotic vision machine; the study of machine behavior, and the study of machine generated images. b) Advance the infrastructure for research and education through the creation of an imaging instrument that will bring together specialists from different disciplines to explore a common computational imaging problem and lead to further arts-engineering collaboration, and c) the intent is to position artistic vision as a contributing force to advancing research and thereby to push recognition of the artistic paradigm as of relevance to the research community. A part of this work will therefore be to identify opportunities that current scientific/engineering research have not explored but that have potential and resonances for both disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have significant educational impact as imaging-computational-robotics is a curriculum and research direction that MAT has desired to integrate for years, and the project will formally set the stage for direct engagement with the controls mechanical engineering branch of the College of Engineering. Dissemination of results will occur in a broader spectrum then conventional research such as engineering conference papers and arts academic presentations. This proposal also includes the creation of a state-of-the-art installation based on the result of the experimental studies, to be circulated in the general public context of exhibitions in museums, where feedback can be further collected.</AbstractNarration>
