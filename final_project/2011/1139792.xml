    <AbstractNarration>The research program, which is in collaboration with Kennametal, Inc., Latrobe, PA, aims to advance the fundamental understanding of nanoscale ceramic composites for potential use in abrasive and cutting tool materials. Ceramic eutectic surface layers will be deposited onto commercial cutting tools via laser solidification, which is a commercially scalable technique. Moreover, the laser processing allows for high processing velocities that lead to well-oriented, nanoscale eutectic microstructures, smaller than that achievable by conventional processes. This resulting nanoscale microstructures are expected to lead to marked property enhancements (e.g. in hardness, strength and wear). The research will develop two classes of eutectics: oxides and carbides for the surface modification of Al2O3- and WC-based cutting tools, respectively. Through quantitative microstructural and mechanical property characterization, the dominant deformation mechanisms and microstructural scaling laws for these classes of ceramic eutectics will be determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program is anticipated to lead to a new method for enhancing the mechanical properties and lifetimes of high-performance cutting tools. The direct interactions with Kennametal Inc. will increase the likelihood that the methods can be quickly adopted and integrated into a commercial process. In addition, the research program will train students, both graduate and undergraduate, in a unique academic/industrial research setting and prepare them to enter and lead the growing fields of laser processing and tribological surface coatings.</AbstractNarration>
