    <AbstractNarration>With a RUI grant from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanism Program in the NSF Chemistry Division, Professor Steven Stevenson will carry out research on oxometallic fullerenes (OMFs), which consist of metallic oxide clusters encapsulated within fullerenes. Research goals include the (1) discovery and synthesis of new OMFs, (2) novel separation methods, (3) functionalization chemistry, and (4) characterization (e.g., magnetic, electrochemical, X-ray, NMR). Stevenson will also develop sustainability technologies to address the depletion of expensive and rare metals (e.g., Sc, Lu) used in their synthesis. A special feature of these OMF molecules is their ability to form clusters containing the most atoms trapped inside a fullerene. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stevenson's sample dissemination network and exchange of scientific ideas includes both domestic and international scientists. The research program promotes participation of undergraduate student researchers at the host institution as well as local community college students at early stages in their academic careers. Students will develop technical skills (e.g., instrumentation, lab work), communication skills (e.g., publications, presentations) and people skills (e.g., lab participation within a team environment). With the proposed plan, a community college/undergraduate student can have 2 to 4 years of research experiences to better prepare themselves for graduate school, industry, or other careers (e.g., medical, pharmacy).</AbstractNarration>
