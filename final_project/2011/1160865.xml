    <AbstractNarration>I/UCRC for Integrated Design-for-Reliability for Electronics (iDRE) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1160865 University of California-Riverside; Albert Wang &lt;br/&gt;1160870 Vanderbilt University; Bharat Bhuva &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of California-Riverside (UC-R) and Vanderbilt University (VU) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with UC-R as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Integrated Design-for-Reliability for Electronics (iDRE) will conduct research on investigating radiation and transient electrostatic discharge (ESD) induced failures to integrated circuits (IC), multi-chip nodules (MCM) and system-in-package (SiP), and microelectronics systems; as well as developing reliability solutions by integrated designs for industrial electronics. An additional objective of the planning grant proposal is to hold a meeting with potential industrial partners to discuss the research needs for integrated design-for-reliability (DfR) and center operation mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, research activities at the iDRE Center will reveal fundamentals and mechanisms of ESD and soft error failures, as well as deliver ESD protection and soft error mitigation solutions to advanced ICs and systems. The research outcomes will cast huge impacts on modern microelectronics and system products, and will have significant benefits to the electronic industry and the nation's economy. The proposed integrated DfR reliability solutions will affect all aspects of human lives, from communications and entertainment, to information processing and storage, to life-threatening devices and mission-critical tasks, and so on. The PIs also propose a diversity plan to promote involvement of female and underrepresented minority students in engineering education and research.</AbstractNarration>
