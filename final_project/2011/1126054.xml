    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation grant supports the acquisition of a fluorescence stereomicroscope&lt;br/&gt;and an imaging system to enhance the research programs of Dr. Darrell J. Killian and Dr. Nancy N.&lt;br/&gt;Huang in the Biology Department at Colorado College. The real-time visualization of fluorescent&lt;br/&gt;molecules in living model organisms has become an indispensable technique because it allows the direct&lt;br/&gt;observation and documentation of changes in gene activity, the localization of proteins within a cell, and&lt;br/&gt;the tracking of cells and tissues during development. An important question in biology is how changes in&lt;br/&gt;gene activity determine sex-specific development. The Killian Lab is interested in the identification and&lt;br/&gt;characterization of genes that affect sex-specific development in the popular model organism&lt;br/&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a soil-dwelling roundworm. C. elegans populations contain males&lt;br/&gt;and hermaphrodites, which have some obvious morphological differences. However, sex-specific cell&lt;br/&gt;type differences in the nervous system are not easy to see. Fluorescent markers for sex-specific cell&lt;br/&gt;types have emerged as powerful and sensitive tools for the identification of defects in sex-specific&lt;br/&gt;development. Mutants have been isolated that are morphologically normal males or hermaphrodites, but&lt;br/&gt;with neurons that are normally only found in the opposite sex. The identification of the genes affected by&lt;br/&gt;these mutations and their subsequent characterization will provide new insights into the genetic basis of&lt;br/&gt;sex-specific development. Fluorescence stereomicroscopy and imaging are essential for the observation&lt;br/&gt;and documentation of sexual defects that are detected in vivo using fluorescent markers for sex-specific&lt;br/&gt;cell types. The Huang Lab is interested in how cellular identity, or cell fate specification, is established.&lt;br/&gt;MEX-3 is a protein that plays an important role in cell fate specification during C. elegans embryonic&lt;br/&gt;development. The MEX-3 protein is initially present in all cells of the embryo but becomes depleted from&lt;br/&gt;the posterior cells by the four-cell stage. This change in MEX-3 distribution is required for the&lt;br/&gt;establishment of the anterior/posterior axis of the embryo, thus it is important to understand how MEX-3 is&lt;br/&gt;localized in the embryo. Preliminary evidence suggests that MEX-3 is actively degraded in a manner that&lt;br/&gt;is dependent upon two different types of protein modifications termed phosphorylation and ubiquitination.&lt;br/&gt;The identification of the specific sites of these modifications within the MEX-3 protein and the&lt;br/&gt;identification of genes that regulate these modifications are of great interest. Fluorescence microscopy&lt;br/&gt;will enable an in vivo study of the stability of fluorescently tagged MEX-3 when specific sites in MEX-3 are&lt;br/&gt;mutated or when other genes in the C. elegans genome are disrupted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colorado College is the only nationally ranked liberal arts college in the Rocky Mountain region of the&lt;br/&gt;United States and enrolls approximately 2000 undergraduates from all over the United States and&lt;br/&gt;internationally. The Biology Department has a strong commitment to conducting original research with&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate collaboration and the fluorescence microscope and imaging system will provide important&lt;br/&gt;research and training opportunities for approximately 6-10 undergraduates working in the Killian and&lt;br/&gt;Huang labs each year. In addition, many courses in the Biology curriculum feature inquiry-based&lt;br/&gt;research lab experiences. Students with such experiences are best equipped to handle any postgraduate&lt;br/&gt;challenges that they might face. The equipment will augment and improve laboratory activities,&lt;br/&gt;demonstrations, and experiments associated with several courses and will impact approximately 200&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates per year. The imaging system will be a particularly valuable teaching tool because it will&lt;br/&gt;enable the instructor and a group of students to simultaneously observe the same sample on a computer&lt;br/&gt;monitor. The Biology Department also plays a strong service role in the college by offering non-majors&lt;br/&gt;courses that foster a strong appreciation for basic biology research and empower students to make&lt;br/&gt;informed decisions and opinions on many popular topics in biology such as stem cell research, gene&lt;br/&gt;therapy, genetically modified organisms, and environmental issues. The fluorescence stereomicroscope&lt;br/&gt;will provide non-majors with unique and exciting opportunities to observe cutting-edge science first-hand.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, Colorado College actively seeks to enhance diversity on campus and the availability of state-ofthe-&lt;br/&gt;art instrumentation, such as a fluorescence stereomicroscope and imaging system, will help attract&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minorities and women to participate in biology research.</AbstractNarration>
