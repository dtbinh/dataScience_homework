    <AbstractNarration>The summer program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (a Minority Serving Institution and the lead institution for NSF's Alabama AMP or Alliance for Minority Participation Program) engages a diverse group of students in interdisciplinary problem based research that has laid the foundation for a model of long-term dynamics in human exploitation of marine biological communities, emphasizing interactions between humans and the environment. This program has enhanced understanding of global culture, biological diversity, and effective strategies in science education. Student activities and projects include: archaeological surveys, mapping, and excavations; collecting and analyzing ethnographic data on resource exploitation, foodways, and domestic social and economic organization; conducting lab analysis of archaeological materials; working with database systems and computer software; and interpreting data in written, digital, and oral presentations for the academic and general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The innovative project produces a model describing millennia of human-environmental interactions. An evolutionary perspective is afforded by the PI-team's expertise in ethnography, archaeology, and historical ecology, providing for the evaluation of changes in marine diversity and resource use through time. A fundamental part of the proposed research is the collaboration of students and faculty from North America, Fiji-based collaborators, and Fijian villagers. These interactions serve to stimulate interest in the understanding and preservation of cultural and natural resources. This project provides a model of innovative strategies for teaching field-based sciences, for disseminating research to educators, and for evaluating the educational effectiveness of this approach. They have developed and continue to develop visual digital media and contribute to technologically savvy curriculum for use in K-16 classrooms throughout the state of Alabama. It is anticipated that an exceptional model for conducting fieldschools will result from the project. This research is expected to have a positive impact on theory and method in anthropology, historical ecology, and science education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include the teaching and training of students and indigenous collaborators in anthropological field methods. The research findings are disseminated via a partnership between this REU site and Alabama Public Television (APT) through APTPLUS, which is APT's 21st century destination for online learning. State-of-the-art technology combined with a wealth of content-rich resources makes learning a dynamic, interactive experience for all ages. Free for educators, adult learners, parents and youth, APTPLUS provides exciting multimedia education. This video-on-demand service offers pre-K through adult learning curriculum content, professional development, national and local video libraries, and links to state and national educational web sites and support materials.&lt;br/&gt;In an effort to reach as many audiences as possible, the REU team also continues to disseminate information through traditional procedures such as scholarly presentations and publications. Data gathered by REU students are used in displays and presentations to the general public in collaboration with UAB, the McWane Science Center, University of the South Pacific, the Fiji Museum, Birmingham City Schools, and APT. Moreover, this experiential learning opportunity equips students with a broad array of skill sets and numerous opportunities to engage with faculty and form supportive relationships that extend well beyond the 9-week REU. By integrating practical research skills, a broad understanding of scientific theories and methods, specific hands-on involvement in a foreign cultural setting, and training in ethics, students emerge from this REU experience with abilities that prepare and serve them in graduate programs in a variety of potential areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) Global Venture Fund.</AbstractNarration>
