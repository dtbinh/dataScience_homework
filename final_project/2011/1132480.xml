    <AbstractNarration>The U.S. GEOTRACES North Atlantic zonal section cruise was scheduled for 15 October through 5 December 2010. Because of a major irresolvable mechanical failure of the ship's propulsion system, the expedition had to be terminated in the Cape Verde Islands on 4 November after completing about one third of the planned track. This required on-the-spot changes in return travel for all sea-going investigators as well as in shipping arrangements for all their samples and equipment. The funds requested in this proposal address the PIs need to cover salary, travel, shipping, and supplies associated with their participation in the continuation of the North Atlantic section cruise scheduled for autumn 2011. The scientist from Wright State College requests one month of summer salary to prepare and participate in the cruise. Travel funds will ensure the scientists can return to their home institutions at the end of the cruise and shipping costs will get the equipment and supplies to the ship and back to their institutions, as well as demobilize the ship once it returns to port. Given that some of the supplies needed to carry out mercury analysis are time sensitive and expire, funds are needed to replace some of the supplies for the second leg of the cruise. The proposed mercury measurements planned for this cruise would significantly further our understanding of how this element cycles in the ocean and bioaccumulates in fish.</AbstractNarration>
