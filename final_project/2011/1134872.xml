    <AbstractNarration>The current award is to The University of Texas at Austin to deploy and support Stampede, a HPC Linux cluster with an initial peak performance of 10 petaflops. The system will have 6,400 Dell Stallion servers, with the servers connected by FDR Infiniband. Each server will have dual processors based on Intel?s forthcoming Sandy Bridge architecture with 32 GB of memory. The system will also include a pre-release version of Intel's forthcoming "Knights Corner" co-processors based on the Intel速 Many Integrated Core ( Intel速 MIC) Architecture: highly parallel co-processors that utilize the x86 instruction set. Stampede will also offer 128 next-generation NVIDIA GPUs for remote visualization, 16 nodes with 1TB of shared memory for large data analysis, and a high-performance file system with 14 petabytes of storage for data-intensive computing. All components will be integrated with a FDR InfiniBand network for extreme scalability. Altogether, Stampede will have a peak performance of over 10 petaflops and over 250 terabytes of memory. Second generation co-processors based on the Intel速 MIC Architecture will be added when they become available, increasing Stampede's peak performance to at least 15 petaflops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This national resource will be available in early 2013 through the NSF Cyberinfrastructure to enable basic research in science and engineering, and will be operated and supported for four years. The project will advance methods for petascale computing including Intel速 MIC Architecture performance optimization, and will develop new expertise in data-intensive computing. The award will enable 1000+ projects in computational and data-driven science and engineering projects to advance knowledge in their fields.</AbstractNarration>
