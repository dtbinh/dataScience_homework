    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports Prof. Carl Batt from Cornell University in his development of educational materials to teach members of the public about nanoscience. The award activities will include the development of an interactive space ("Nanooze: A Chemistry Extravaganza") to engage members of the public with nanoscience -- to be housed at Disneyland -- as well as the development and dissemination of print and web-based materials, including the "Nanooze" magazine. The work includes assessment of the various activities. The site at Disneyland will reach a large number of citizens, and the demographics of those impacted are likely to be quite different from those who might be exposed to similar exhibits at science museums. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscience is the study of matter in the scale between the atomic/molecular and the macroscopic. Matter in this size regime show interesting and unique properties -- properties that enable new kinds of materials and devices. Work like that of Prof. Batt is aimed at introducing a broad cross-section of American society to this burgeoning area of research. In addition, connecting young people with current areas of science enables the Foundation to more effectively encourage young people to pursue careers in the science and technology sectors.</AbstractNarration>
