    <AbstractNarration>The project aims to address student retention and graduation in STEM by providing innovative teaching technologies in introductory mathematics courses, a pre-freshman summer bridge, undergraduate research opportunities, faculty development workshops, and graduate school preparation activities in the STEM academic programs at Elizabeth City State University. This project will emphasize learning with technology, content and pedagogy for inquiry-based learning, and faculty professional development in new media and instructional technology to raise achievement of STEM majors and non-STEM majors in the algebra, pre-calculus and calculus courses. Faculty learning communities will be created to support faculty in developing problem-based learning pedagogies and use of new media and instructional technology, and techniques to integrate successful practices into effective teaching and learning for STEM students. The pre-freshman summer bridge, a STEM freshman seminar course, a special college algebra course for STEM majors, and a STEM learning community through peer-led supplemental instruction are the strategies employed to increase retention of STEM freshman. A mentoring program, a "Vikings Explorer's Academy" for sophomores, undergraduate research opportunities, and preparation workshops for graduate school are the strategies employed to address persistence and graduation rates in STEM.</AbstractNarration>
