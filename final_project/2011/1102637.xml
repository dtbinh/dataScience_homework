    <AbstractNarration>The Center for Sustainable Materials Chemistry will focus on fundamental aspects of the aqueous chemistry of inorganic nanoclusters and their transformation to solids. It will explore new approaches to synthesizing inorganic clusters and how to tune their reactivity by coupling theory with experiment. It will prepare from the clusters dense and porous thin solid films with minimum energy input and unprecedented control, emphasizing the so-called green elements in the periodic table. The chemical transformations leading to these high-quality films will be investigated with various techniques offering near-atomic resolution capabilities. By applying the film chemistry to lamination, the center will study and tune reactions -neutralization, metathesis, interdiffusion, and redox - providing insights on basic chemistry processes involving these materials. By pushing the film chemistry to ultra-thin limits (&lt; 1 nm), the center will open new opportunities to synthesize targeted compositions and structures Beyond the Molecular Frontier. This research holds promise of transforming current technologies to produce high performance materials at dimensions &lt; 10 nm with potential broad applications from electronic device fabrication to optical coatings and use in energy storage materials and applications using environmentally benign methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center is committed to education at all levels. Graduate students and postdoctoral associates will have access to professional development opportunities in entrepreneurship, teaching, immersion courses, and public communication. A pilot effort to a high school with a diverse population will promote learning through a graduate-student-in-residence program. It will develop a web-based public outreach initiative and accompany this with outreach events across Oregon to build awareness of how chemistry research contributes to a healthy economy and societal well-being. Activities of the center in these areas as well as its &lt;br/&gt;science initiatives will be monitored by an external advisory board and evaluation consultants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Sustainable Materials Chemistry is funded as part of the Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) program.</AbstractNarration>
