    <AbstractNarration>MIRT: Stressed Polymers - Exploiting Tension in Soft Matter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanical stress is integral to all living and many synthetic systems, from cells and muscles to catalysts and elastomers. It underpins the most common types of actions, responses, and stimuli. The general goal of this MIRT is to develop new principles in soft materials design, ones wherein mechanical stress in materials is generated, managed, and harvested by molecular engineering. One specific goal is to explore the interplay between the stress state of macroscopic materials and the chemistry of specific, addressable bonds within them. Novel materials functions will be made possible through controlled self-generation of bond tension and the intelligent processing of both internal and external stress into activation of specific chemical bonds. The other goal is to design multifunctional polymer particles and substrates that autonomously change their shape, surface structure, mechanical, and optical properties. The Team will further exploit its know-how in the fabrication of nanostructured objects with unprecedented fidelity and uniformity to prepare the next generation of shape-memory particles and substrates, designed to store mechanical stress and focus it at the molecular level via controlled strain release. The outlined goals will be achieved through interdisciplinary research, international collaboration, and interactive teamwork of synthetic chemists, experimental and theoretical physicist, and engineers across three campuses of the University of North Carolina, Carnegie Mellon University, and Duke University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project will provide considerable opportunity for innovation and technology transfer, integrating science into education, and broadening participation of underrepresented groups. Increasing diversity for enhanced research innovation and collaboration is an integral dimension of the UNC MIRT: diversity in race and gender will complement the diversity of thoughts, skills, backgrounds, and disciplines. The education program includes four key constituents: 1) Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates focused on minorities and women from neighboring Historically Black Colleges and Universities and women's colleges with research, education, and social events; 2) Year round mentoring for undergraduate and high school students with active participation in the full cycle of MIRT research activities; 3) Graduate education with research support, travel awards and a new personal development program focused on innovation, diversity, and communication skills; 4) Junior researcher engagement for 7th-12th graders with activities to increase their exposure to, and enthusiasm and interest in, innovative science.</AbstractNarration>
