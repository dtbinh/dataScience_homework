    <AbstractNarration>This project explores the design and use of multi-lifespan information systems; that is, information systems that not only meet the needs of today's users but can also maintain their usefulness beyond a single human lifespan. Specifically, the project will (a) test the feasibility of a multi-lifespan information system design approach; (b) generate preliminary design knowledge and methods for multi-lifespan information system design; and (c) contribute meaningful information system designs in our domain of study - international justice. To achieve these goals, the project will leverage the Voices from the Rwanda Tribunal testbed in two types of research activities: multi-lifespan information system envisioning; and digital information tagging and meaning making from a multi-lifespan perspective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project will explore the feasibility of the potentially transformative multi-lifespan approach, including: (a) envisioning futures responsive to the information needs, concerns, and values of different generations; (b) through conceptual, technical and policy-oriented mechanisms, anticipating and supporting shifts in societal, political and technological conditions; and (c) conducting preliminary investigations into how to involve the public in interacting with deployed multi-lifespan systems. The project work is likely to catalyze new design methods and technical mechanisms, ones that can account for divergent futures, evolving socio-political situations, and robust information system adaptability. New techniques for managing privacy, security, and freedom of expression are anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This research will promote important societal values including human rights, security, freedom of expression, and peace-building; and inform developments in the field of international justice. The results will also be highly relevant for other digital collections that are intended to outlast the creators' lifespans.</AbstractNarration>
