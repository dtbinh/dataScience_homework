    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Holly R. Cashman (University of New Hampshire) will undertake research on language dominance, maintenance, and shift. Traditional research on language choice relies primarily on a nuclear-family based model of language and ethnic identity transmission. In contrast, Cashman's research will focus on language and identity among people who have strong community identities that do not conform to the nuclear family model. The research will be carried out in Phoenix, Arizona, among speakers of Spanish and English. Research methods include discourse and conversation analysis of materials acquired through formal interviews and participant observation. The researcher will engage graduate and undergraduate students, as well as community members in the research, and will disseminate findings beyond the traditional academic settings and publication venues.</AbstractNarration>
