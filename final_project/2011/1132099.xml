    <AbstractNarration>Successful ATE projects and centers are expected to be sustained and have an impact. The goal of this project is to better understand the factors that help sustain successful projects and centers and how those factors can be used to inform ongoing and future projects and centers. The project builds on previous research in which 216 ATE projects and centers responded with degree of agreement to peer-generated statements on sustainability and impact using a Lickert scale. It was found that many components of projects and centers are sustained even if the structure of the project is not and many projects have an impact on their own institution, other institutions, faculty and students. The present project mines these and other data further to clarify what is meant by sustainability, to identify factors related to it and to create new ways of measuring sustainability. The impact data are analyzed to determine the factors that influence the impact that occurs. A review committee evaluates the draft and final reports.</AbstractNarration>
