    <AbstractNarration>The Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement Laboratory (PRIME Lab) routinely measures 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl and 129I in rock, soil, water, and air for a large community of NSF-sponsored and other users providing i) state-of-the-art measurements for routinely-utilized radionuclides for the NSF user community, ii) chemical preparation services for those NSF investigators who do not have their own in-house laboratories or expertise, iii) new measurement techniques that will be used in future geoscience investigations, and iv) NSF geoscience investigators with the knowledge needed to apply radionuclides to geoscience problems. The measurement of radionuclides by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is an essential component of the study of Earth surface processes and Quaternary geology. These radionuclides are used to date landforms, fluids, and sediments, and to determine rates of erosion, soil formation, and tectonic deformation, geologic processes that directly impact human populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These measurements are reported in hundreds of scientific reports published in numerous internationally recognized journals. We are actively engaged in teaching sample preparation methods to the next generation of researchers, independent of their affiliation. PRIME Lab also employs numerous undergraduate Purdue University students, teaching them the basics of data acquisition and data analysis. PRIME Lab plays a significant role in the larger education community in the West Lafayette area. Working together with the College of Science counselor and the Department of Physics Outreach Director, PRIME Lab hosts hundreds of students annually on laboratory tours.</AbstractNarration>
