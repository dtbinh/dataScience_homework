    <AbstractNarration>Computational creativity is a young, highly interdisciplinary field incorporating insights and results from cognitive science, artificial intelligence, design, human computing interaction, mathematics, art and linguistics among others. As a result, there is still a significant communication gap amongst contributors to the field. The International Conference on Computational Creativity seeks to bridge this gap by creating a unified forum for discussion and exchange of ideas, and the workshop session is designed to foster broad participation and act as a forum for new participants in the conversation. The award will facilitate this participation by providing travel support for participants that would like to join the conversations who will not present peer reviewed papers, but who would be benefited by exposure to established computational creativity researchers. In addition, it will further this cooperation by funding mentoring activities that pair established researchers with workshop participants.</AbstractNarration>
