    <AbstractNarration>Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Cyber-Physical Systems for the Hospital Operating Room &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1134866 University of Houston; Marc Garbey &lt;br/&gt;1134842 University of Florida; Scott Berceli &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Houston and the University of Florida are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with the University of Houston as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Cyber-Physical Systems for the Hospital Operating Room (CPSOR) vision is to provide the forum for industry/hospital/university cooperative research on the further development, validation, and industrial implementation of the emerging concepts in the design of operating room, and in the optimization of procedural and surgical interventions. This center will be the strong arm of Modern Surgery enabled by computational science and technologies. The center will catalyze large-scale technology projects that request inter-disciplinary efforts between surgeons and computational science in a broad sense. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaboration should advance technology, discovery, understanding and training in the operating room. It will utilize the facilities in Houston and spread technology coupled with medical skills which will benefit society. The center will operate at the core of the Texas Medical Center that is the largest medical center in the word, and benefit from the site in University of Florida Gainesville that has been a champion to encourage business startups in bioengineering and technology transfer. The center will also benefit from the forty million dollar infrastructure of the Methodist Institute for Technology Innovation and Education (MITIE) that trains about 2000 surgeons per year coming from all over the word. The center will benefit from a new established unique international dual curriculum in computational surgery.</AbstractNarration>
