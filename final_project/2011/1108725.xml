    <AbstractNarration>In this collaborative project the Principal Investigators (PIs) will&lt;br/&gt;investigate mathematical models for topological phases of matter and their&lt;br/&gt;application to the nascent field of quantum information. Examples of&lt;br/&gt;topological phases of matter include Fractional Quantum Hall liquids and&lt;br/&gt;topological insulators: materials subjected to extreme physical conditions&lt;br/&gt;(e.g. near zero Kelvin, under large magnetic forces) which appear to&lt;br/&gt;exhibit topological behavior. The main objectives of the project are to&lt;br/&gt;better understand the taxonomy of these exotic states of matter through&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models, address physically and computationally motivated&lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems, and apply topological and algebraic methods to&lt;br/&gt;study them. For example, the issue of quantum computational power&lt;br/&gt;(universality) may be analyzed by finding the images of the braid groups&lt;br/&gt;under representations associated to a particular model. Moreover, the&lt;br/&gt;extant hypothesized models for topological states of matter do not capture&lt;br/&gt;all of the subtleties (such as fermionic topological order) so the PIs&lt;br/&gt;will develop new models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classical states of matter of solid, liquid and gas have more refined&lt;br/&gt;classifications: for example, solid crystals may be differentiated by&lt;br/&gt;their symmetries. Newly discovered topological materials have yet to be&lt;br/&gt;fully understood, but potentially can be used to build (quantum)&lt;br/&gt;computational devices out-performing standard micro-chip based computers.&lt;br/&gt;The most commonly encountered model for quantum computation, the quantum&lt;br/&gt;circuit model, requires challenging, if not impossible, accuracy on the&lt;br/&gt;hardware to be of practical value due to local interactions of the system&lt;br/&gt;with the surrounding environment. The topological model based on exotic&lt;br/&gt;states of matter, while mathematically more complicated, has a built-in&lt;br/&gt;tolerance for such interactions. The PIs will mathematically study these&lt;br/&gt;exotic states of matter focusing on their application to new computational&lt;br/&gt;paradigms with potentially significant benefit to society.</AbstractNarration>
