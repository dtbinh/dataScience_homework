    <AbstractNarration>CBET 1134944&lt;br/&gt;University of California-Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;Herr&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel funds are requested to partially support new and junior researchers to attend the 15th International Conference on Miniaturized Systems for Chemistry and Life Sciences (microTAS) held from October 2nd through 6th, 2011 in Seattle, WA USA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international meeting will involve participants from all research sectors including academia, industry, and the US federal government. This conference is considered a unique forum for exchange of ideas and offers ample opportunities for the exchange of new ideas, presentation and discussion f breaking results, and opportunities for new interdisciplinary collaborations among attendees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MicroTAS conference provides a unique intellectual experience in which scientific researchers from different disciplines come together in a dynamic international forum to discuss research and forge partnerships that are critical to the health and growth of our highly multidisciplinary field. The conference includes extended time for discussions where scientific researchers, both junior and senior, from many disciplines can share and develop new ideas in an open and collegial environment. We are also encouraging informal interactions (e.g., lunches) to foment new technical collaborations and international partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals and broader impacts of the 2011 microTAS Conference include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) To further the understanding of the science that underpins the development of microfluidic and nanofluidic technologies;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) To provide an opportunity for junior researchers to interact closely with more established scientific researchers to broaden their scientific education and to promote their future careers as scientific researchers;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) To foster and promote long-term relationships between researchers in diverse fields including bioengineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemistry (including separation science and analytical chemistry), and physics; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(4) To promote the development of multidisciplinary teams that can address difficult problems in biological and the physical sciences using micro- and nano-technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF support is being requested to offset conference fees and/or travel costs for graduate students, post-docs, and other junior academic researchers. It is anticipated&lt;br/&gt;that with increased financial support, the fifteenth conference in this series will be successful in promoting advances in the scientific understanding and application of microfluidic technologies, and in educating the next cadre of world-class innovators.</AbstractNarration>
