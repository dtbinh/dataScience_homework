    <AbstractNarration>The Acoustic-Articulator Modeling EArly Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) investigates the use of three-dimensional Electromagnetic Articulograph (EMA) technology to create improved pronunciation error analysis and corrective articulatory feedback. This improved EMA technology is a recent development, and there are no speech or language data sets currently available that include such high resolution three dimensional position/orientation information. This EAGER investigates the potential of this type of data. A matched acoustic-kinematic corpus with five degree of freedom EMA data is being collected, across both native and nonnative (Mandarin Chinese) speakers of English. The project investigates methods for normalizing speakers' articulatory data into a common reference frame and disseminating the data to the broader research community to promote continued work in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current tools for pronunciation assessment are very limited in the specificity of the corrective pronunciation feedback that can be provided, due to limitations of our ability to accurately map acoustic inputs to corresponding articulator patterns and obtain detailed analysis of the manner and degree of pronunciation errors. The development of effective tools for Computer Aided Language Learning (CALL) is an essential component of enabling nonnative speakers of English to quickly integrate into America's 21st century global workforce. Better tools for pronunciation assessment and accent modification can have tremendous impact on workforce effectiveness, especially within key sectors related to medicine, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, where it is important to continue to attract and support top talent from across the globe.</AbstractNarration>
