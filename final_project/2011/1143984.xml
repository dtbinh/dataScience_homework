    <AbstractNarration>Although many trace metals, such as zinc (Zn), act as vital nutrients for marine microorganisms, their oceanic biogeochemical cycles are poorly understood. In this research, chemists from Arizona State University and the University of Washington would use a suite of experimental, analytical, and computational research to quantitatively understand the fractionation of stable Zn isotopes that takes place on mineral surfaces in the ocean. Through advancing our understanding of the reactions involved in Zn isotope fractionation in the ocean, future scientists would be able to successfully apply isotopic zinc cycling to questions of greater oceanographic interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, this study would provide new insights into the biogeochemical cycling of the micronutrient zinc. One graduate student and one undergraduate student at Arizona State University would be supported and trained as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>
