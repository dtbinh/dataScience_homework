    <AbstractNarration>This research project will study human-machine interaction such as haptic and medical sensing devices to customize and embed sensors (e.g. force) to accommodate wearer-specifications. Many mechatronic devices that interact with the human body require wearer-specific geometry to function adequately. Examples include instrumented /sensorized orthotic, haptic and medical devices and safety and computer interface equipment. The project will yield a novel sensor design and such methodology. Fabrication of the sensor will be achieved with Layered Manufacturing (LM) processes capable of creating multiple different materials within the same part to combine flexible and rigid structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enable the development of low cost, sensorized smart interfaces with increased comfort that can facilitate the routine use of these devices at home for medical, computer and other daily activities requiring monitoring capability. In addition, this project will initiate undergraduate students (including students from under-represented groups) to research in mechatronics applied to rehabilitation. Collaborative projects on mechatronics with the science and technology high schools of Massachusetts will be established.</AbstractNarration>
