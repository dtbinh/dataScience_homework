    <AbstractNarration>The tenth Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium (ANTS) meeting will be held July 9-13, 2012, at the University of California, San Diego. It will include approximately 5 invited lectures, about 25 contributed lectures chosen through a competitive review process, and a poster session. It is expected that 100-150 mathematicians will attend, including a sizable fraction of graduate students and postdocs and some scientists from nonacademic institutions. There will also be a proceedings volume issued shortly after the conclusion of the meeting. The ANTS meetings, held biannually since 1994, are the premier international forum for new research in computational number theory. They are devoted to algorithmic aspects of number theory, including elementary number theory, algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, geometry of numbers, arithmetic algebraic geometry, finite fields, and cryptography. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an established conference series, ANTS attracts invited and contributed lectures of the highest quality, and serves as a forum for dissemination of new ideas and techniques throughout the research community in the area of computational number theory. The review process for contributed lectures and the subsequent production of a proceedings volume provides documentation of the presented results at the level of quality of an international research journal in mathematics. The ANTS meeting also serves an important training function, by drawing (with partial funding) many US-based graduate students and postdocs (for whom partial funding will be available), who will benefit both from exposure to the latest work in computational number theory and from the opportunity to present their own work. In addition, the interaction between academic, industry, and government researchers should prove mutually beneficial to all sides.</AbstractNarration>
