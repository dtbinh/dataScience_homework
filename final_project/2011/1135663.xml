    <AbstractNarration>This project provides support for U.S. undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty to participate in the Transatlantic Joint Conference of the Society for Mathematical Biology and the European Society for Mathematical and Theoretical Biology. The conference is being held in Krak√≥w, Poland, June 28 - July 2, 2011. The meeting is a forum for established researchers to discuss and highlight existing gaps in the state of the art and for junior faculty and students to delineate areas where they can make successful contributions in the future. The conference also promotes collaboration and development of both experimental and theoretical studies of biological systems and to expose undergraduate and graduate student, postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty to problems in mathematical and computational biology. This joint transatlantic conference also encourages scientific exchange and collaboration between mathematical biologists in the U.S.A. and Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is organized specifically to provide interactions between senior researchers, junior faculty, and graduate students. The poster session plays a key role in facilitating such interaction. In addition, the conference has a mentoring scheme that aims to improve the educational and professional experience of scientists at the conference by introducing junior and senior scientists with similar research interests. Travel Conference awardees participate in the conference mentoring program where they have a unique opportunity to learn how scientific research and academic professional growth occurs in Europe.</AbstractNarration>
