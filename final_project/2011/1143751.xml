    <AbstractNarration>The 4th International IASPEI/IAEE Symposium on the Effects of Surface Geology on Seismic&lt;br/&gt;Motion (ESG) will be held at the University of California, Santa Barbara from 23 ? 26 August&lt;br/&gt;2011. Approximately 250 scientists and engineers from around the world are expected to attend&lt;br/&gt;this symposium to present the latest results on how local site conditions affect ground motion&lt;br/&gt;induced by earthquakes. Since the 3rd Symposium in Grenoble in 2006, there have been&lt;br/&gt;significant earthquakes in Japan, China, Italy, Haiti, Chile, Mexico, and New Zealand that have&lt;br/&gt;provided a wealth of data. In particular, the 2010 Darfield event in New Zealand and the 2011&lt;br/&gt;Tohoku event in Japan induced widespread liquefaction. Analysis of the data from these events&lt;br/&gt;and dissemination of the results to larger communities will aid in the mitigation of damaging&lt;br/&gt;effects from earthquakes in the future.&lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring together an international community of earthquake scientists and&lt;br/&gt;engineers. It will promote an interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and provide everyone with a&lt;br/&gt;perspective on the current state-of-art research into the fundamental problems associated with&lt;br/&gt;quantifying the effects of the local site geology.&lt;br/&gt;The papers presented at the conference will be published on a CD-ROM and distributed to all&lt;br/&gt;registered participants. The papers will also be available through the conference website to the&lt;br/&gt;general public.</AbstractNarration>
