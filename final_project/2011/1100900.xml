    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop a manufacturing process for producing complex nanoscale circuits for future electronics and other applications by "writing" with electrically activated nano-tip "fountain pens". The process, termed "electro-fountain pen (EFP) lithography", takes advantage of electromigration-induced flow of liquid metal, and enables continuous writing of nanoscale patterns with a metallic liquid for making high quality electrical circuits. The technique eliminates the main drawback of current tip-based lithography techniques by being able to continuously deliver the writing material to the tip without the need for frequent replenishment. Because the flow is driven electrically, EFP lithography may be used to continuously transport not only metallic liquids via electromigration, but also non-metallic liquids by electrophoresis. The planned effort will develop the tool, optimize the conditions for laying down adherent patterns of several materials on different substrates, and study the physics of liquid electromigration and its dependence on material and process parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefit to society of this research will include the development of a new nano-manufacturing process, which may eventually lead to commercialization. The process has the potential to be a new and effective method for making complex nano-patterns on substrates for applications ranging from electronics to sensors to bio-molecular assaying, and is therefore likely to have significant impact on the nation?s manufacturing base. In addition, this effort will integrate research and education by advancing discovery and understanding by graduate students. Undergraduate students will participate in the research through the Research Experience for Undergraduates program, and high school interns will be hired to assist with the aim of attracting them to engineering. Results of the project will be broadly disseminated through faculty and student participation at meetings of learned societies and grantees' conferences of the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation division of NSF.</AbstractNarration>
