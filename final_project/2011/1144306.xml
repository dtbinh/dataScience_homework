    <AbstractNarration>This workshop brings together political scientists and legal scholars within the Law and Social Sciences discipline to facilitate greater intellectual coherence in the future research directions of scholars studying the role of comparative and international law. The workshop will assess the extent to which current graduate training and current programmatic focus can be altered in the future in order to facilitate greater intellectual synergy among scholars in this area. As such, the two day workshop will bring together leading junior and senior scholars in this area to define the expected research needs and propose research directions for scholarship and training in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is anticipated to strengthen existing interdisciplinary engagement within the Law and Social Sciences discipline -- it brings together law faculty with their social science counterparts around key research questions as well as common programmatic concerns.</AbstractNarration>
