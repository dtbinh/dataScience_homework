    <AbstractNarration>Since 2003, the ACM International Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys) has served as a high caliber, cross disciplinary forum for research on systems issues in embedded and networked sensors. SenSys, a single track forum, addresses issues that span multiple research areas, including wireless communication, networking, operating systems, architecture, low power circuits, distributed algorithms, data processing, scheduling, sensors, energy harvesting, and signal processing. Student participation in top research venues, such as SenSys, is critical for a vibrant research community. Further, students often have limited sources of funds to travel to conferences. Bringing students together with experienced practitioners enriches existing research projects and creates new collaborations. Travel grants will be awarded based on need. This award will support to cover travel and conference registration expenses for twenty students and help increase the representation and participation of graduate students in SenSys.</AbstractNarration>
