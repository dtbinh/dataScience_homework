    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase-II project develops advanced&lt;br/&gt;technology capabilities for constructing and deploying client-adapted&lt;br/&gt;automated language translation systems within commercial settings that are&lt;br/&gt;used by globalizing enterprises and the language service provider companies&lt;br/&gt;(LSPs) that provide translation services to such enterprise clients. The&lt;br/&gt;developed technology leverages databases of previously-translated material in&lt;br/&gt;order to produce client-adapted high-quality fully-automatic translations for&lt;br/&gt;commercial language service providers (LSPs) and their enterprise clients.&lt;br/&gt;This approach provides a scalable and less-costly solution for&lt;br/&gt;creating and deploying client-specific customized Machine Translation (MT)&lt;br/&gt;engines. Once deployed, these customized MT systems expand the capabilities&lt;br/&gt;of clients to translate volumes of content that are not feasible to translate&lt;br/&gt;using current methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the impact&lt;br/&gt;that it will have on the broad commercial translation industry. The&lt;br/&gt;technology developed in the project is likely to significantly reduce barriers&lt;br/&gt;to wide-spread adoption of MT technology by the broad LSP industry and their&lt;br/&gt;enterprise client-base. The 2010 commercial translation market is a $26&lt;br/&gt;billion industry, growing at a healthy pace. Current commercial MT offerings&lt;br/&gt;are expensive and too difficult to deploy for most enterprises and service&lt;br/&gt;providers. Free web-based translation services serve casual users, but do not&lt;br/&gt;meet the quality and security needs of enterprises. The technology developed&lt;br/&gt;in this project and the cloud-based delivery model support scalable,&lt;br/&gt;easy-to-integrate MT services, which are highly attractive to a broad range of&lt;br/&gt;potential clients. This approach will support cost-effective content generation into&lt;br/&gt;multiple target languages at a massive scale, a capability that is essential&lt;br/&gt;for globalizing US enterprises in order to compete in the information-rich&lt;br/&gt;market place of the 21st century.</AbstractNarration>
