    <AbstractNarration>The MassBay Scholarship for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (MSTEM) program at MassBay Community College supports ten full-time, rising sophomore STEM scholars that as freshmen maintained a 3.25 science and cumulative GPA; exhibited strong research and/or engineering skills; demonstrated a passion for science and/or engineering and a commitment to an industry career and/or baccalaureate STEM degree; as well as financial need. MSTEM Scholars are receiving scholarships covering tuition, fees and books; Career Mentoring and Academic Bridging Workshops; opportunities to secure a summer research internship relevant to their STEM interest; and intensive and continuous mentoring that persists after their MSTEM experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program includes a highly replicable, national model that increases participation by nontraditional scholars who are underrepresented in STEM academia and careers. MSTEM uses a proven project-based learning model that engages scholars in authentic research and builds upon established mentoring and retention processes that foster and sustain nontraditional undergraduate scholars into STEM careers in ways that expand the pipeline of nontraditional individuals into the American technology workforce. A major component of the MSTEM is its partnerships between industry, colleges and universities that converge to assure the success of scholars.</AbstractNarration>
