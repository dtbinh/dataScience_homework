    <AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator will organize an international community workshop and symposium in Bulgaria to foster interdisciplinary research and education. This sympoium will be held during September 12-16, 2011, in the Bulgarian town of Borovets near the capital of Sofia. The proposed Second International Symposium on Recent Observations and Simulations of the Sun-Earth System (ISROSES-II) will provide a forum for scientists from all space physics communities to present and discuss recent advances in modeling and observations of the Sun-Earth System. This symposium is a continuation of the highly successful ISROSES symposium held in Varna, Bulgaria, during September 17-22, 2006. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each day of the symposium will be devoted to a primary science topic, including both the observational and modeling aspects of: (1) solar wind - magnetosphere interactions; (2) magnetosphere - ionosphere - thermosphere coupling; (3) dynamics of the near-Earth space environment; and (4) new measurement, data analysis, and simulation techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main goals of the Symposium is to improve "understanding and prediction of processes affecting solar activity and the propagation of resulting solar effects to the Earth via the solar wind," which has been a prime objective of the NSF's National Space Weather Program (NSWP). ISROSES-II is also relevant to the strategic goals and focus aeas of the NSF's Solar, Heliospheric, and INterplanetary Environment (SHINE) community, the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) community, and the Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) community.</AbstractNarration>
