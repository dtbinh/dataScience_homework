    <AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to obtain a high resolution bathymetric mapping capability through the acquisition of a multibeam sonar and a pan and tilt actuator. Together these items will create a versatile mapping capability for complex underwater scenes distinct from other vehicles used by the scientific community. These instruments will provide a means for multiscalar visual and acoustic mapping over scales from a square kilometer with 10's of cm accuracies down to hundreds of square meters with millimeter accuracy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High resolution bathymetric maps have become essential tools for the study of marine archaeology and oceanography, particularly marine geology. The ability to efficiently make bathymetric maps will enable the PI's to better understand the geological landscape of dive sites and provide a context for collected samples. These tools will also complete the suite of mapping sensors and greatly facilitate complementary engineering effort of developing techniques for robotic mapping. The requested items will give the PI's the capability to mapping fully vertical and complex underwater scenes appropriately using the freedom provided by the pan and tilt actuator and develop methodologies for creating 3D texture mapped representations of the seafloor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition will further an extensive outreach program which focuses on the link between science and technology. Techniques and data will be incorporated into the Educator-At-Sea program and the public outreach arm of the Nautilus Program. This provides the ability to engage the general public and provide experiences to K-12 teachers. The Nautilus program incorporates a large education and training effort for science and engineering students. Partnerships will be developed between students at URI and collaborative institutions. Bathymetric data will also be made available to the oceanographic community through the Nautilus' Doctors-on-call program. The PIs have a history of participation opportunities for underrepresented groups and through the Nautilus program will continue to provide such opportunities. The real-time interactive broadcast of seafloor exploration provides excellent opportunities for broad participation even if everyone is not able to be on the ship in remote locations with the PIs. Benefits to society will likely be realized both in technological advances towards exploring and understanding our environment and through the anthropological/archaeological nature of much of the PIs work.</AbstractNarration>
