    <AbstractNarration>This project aims to investigate and develop models to describe the effects of molecular chemistry, chemical environment, interface topography, and thermo-mechanical cycling on interfacial fracture toughness and thermal conductance at model metal-ceramic interfaces modified with molecular nanolayers. Tailoring adherent metal-ceramic interfaces using near-zero-thickness nanolayers is an attractive method to preserve the functionality, stability and reliability of materials systems for many emergent applications, e.g., nanoelectronics, device packaging and wiring, and biological implants. The effects of nanolayer chemistry on interfacial toughness will be studied in model metal/ceramic interfaces subject to different loading conditions to obtain insights into the nanoscale mechanics of interfacial fracture. The results of these studies will be applied to investigate and exploit the coupling between molecular bonding and interfacial heat transport. The resultant understanding of the interface-chemistry-physics-mechanical-thermal property relationships is anticipated to enable new ways for rational molecular-level tailoring of interfacial properties for tailoring a wide variety of materials systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide a molecular-level understanding for tailoring the stability and thermomechanical properties of soft-hard hetero-interfaces, and paves way for rational design of a wide variety of composite materials and archictectures for engineering applications. On the educational front, this project will serve as a platform for cross-disciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students from a PhD-granting research university (RPI) and an undergraduate-only college (E&amp;H), respectively, through collaboration on a problem of key importance at the cusp of materials science, chemistry and mechanical engineering. The complementary execution of two research thrusts through summer visits and periodic meetings will enrich the research and educational experience of graduate and undergraduate students in both groups. The research will be integrated into extant courses at both institutions. Site-visits and a summer internship for a high-school teacher are planned to K-12 students to the latest developments in the field of nanomaterials interfaces and their importance in emerging engineering applications.</AbstractNarration>
