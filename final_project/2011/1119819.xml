    <AbstractNarration>Natural disturbances are major factors affecting the carbon balance of ecosystems because they disrupt carbon stocks and increase atmospheric emissions. Disturbances of forests in western North America are expected to increase in frequency, extent, intensity and variety. However, fundamental questions remain about the effects of disturbance on carbon sequestration. The goal of this project is to improve understanding of the consequences of multiple disturbances on carbon sequestration in forests. Measured tree regeneration and carbon contents, geographic information systems, and modeling will be used to examine the outcomes of multiple interacting disturbances for carbon sequestration. A forest growth model will be used to estimate biomass accumulation and evaluate carbon sequestration across the landscape and under a variety of management and disturbance scenarios. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cascading large-scale disturbances such as drought, insect infestations, and fire will interact to shape future forest landscapes and consequently carbon balances. Forest management activities will also influence and be influenced by disturbances. This research builds on a database of soils and regeneration in northern Colorado that shows evidence of thresholds in forest recovery resulting from disturbance interactions. The proposed project will lend valuable insights into management options. A significant component of this work will be devoted to the support of two Doctoral students and the participation of several undergraduates. Every effort will be made to recruit graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups through the Colorado Diversity Initiative in Science, Math, and Engineering. Research activities will be integrated into ecological education using case studies as experiential learning tools. This work will also be used in University of Colorado Landscape Ecology courses for students in interdisciplinary decision making curricula. Dialog with U.S. Forest Service offices in the Rocky Mountain Region will be maintained throughout this project, with a workshop conducted for resource managers in the final year of the project.</AbstractNarration>
