    <AbstractNarration>Relative to the majority of proteins encoded by animal and plant genomes, those responsible for reproductive processes change quickly over evolutionary time. More specifically, protein-coding genes expressed in reproductive tissues routinely show signatures of rapid evolution. This trend is currently thought to arise as a consequence of sexual selection after mating, which occurs when the gametes of one sex compete for access to the gametes of the other sex. In seahorses and pipefishes, males nurture developing offspring in a placenta-like reproductive tissue known as the brood pouch. There is great variation across this family of fishes in the strength of competition among females for access to this male reproductive resource. Using the latest in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, the investigators will test the prediction that male reproductive proteins evolve more rapidly in species subject to intense post-mating sexual selection compared to species with little post-mating sexual selection. The data will also shed light on evolutionary changes in patterns of gene expression specific to male reproductive roles and the male's brood pouch. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to addressing the central hypothesis, this work will generate an unprecedented number of DNA sequence resources for seahorse and pipefish biology. This information will be useful in many basic and applied contexts, including the development of genetics tools for the conservation of seahorses and their relatives, many of which are imperiled due to over-harvesting and environmental change. The project will also stimulate collaboration with international scientists and public outreach through the the Dallas World Aquarium.</AbstractNarration>
