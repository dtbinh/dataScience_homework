    <AbstractNarration>The focus of this project is the analysis of numerical schemes, and&lt;br/&gt;the development of algorithms, to simulate materials which exhibit&lt;br/&gt;intricate rheological behavior or mechanical response due to their&lt;br/&gt;microstructural makeup. Examples include polymers, liquid crystals,&lt;br/&gt;and blood, whose elastic molecules or cells influence the macroscopic&lt;br/&gt;properties at the macroscopic scale. These materials are modeled by&lt;br/&gt;formidable systems of partial differential equations whose structural&lt;br/&gt;properties capture important properties and physical principles, and&lt;br/&gt;it is important to develop numerical schemes to faithfully inherit&lt;br/&gt;these. This project will bring together tools from partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, continuum mechanics, and numerical analysis,&lt;br/&gt;to analyze numerical schemes to simulate these systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to simulate complex materials is a key technology required&lt;br/&gt;for the design and development of many next generation products such&lt;br/&gt;as micro-mechanical devices, ink jets, bio-materials, solar energy&lt;br/&gt;devices, and prosthetic organs. Predicting material response is an&lt;br/&gt;essential tool needed to determine biological or physiological&lt;br/&gt;function; or to design and manufacture these materials; or for the&lt;br/&gt;design of the multitudes of devices which use their special&lt;br/&gt;properties. The research proposed here will result in improved&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the mathematical models and the computational tools&lt;br/&gt;used to accomplish these tasks.</AbstractNarration>
