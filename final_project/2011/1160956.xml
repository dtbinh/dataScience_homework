    <AbstractNarration>Elmhurst College is implementing a "Keys to Success Through Year One" (KEYSTONE) program that is focusing on increasing the number of STEM graduates in biology, chemistry, computer science, exercise science, mathematics, physics, and cognitive psychology by 36% by reducing attrition of first-year students. The project is addressing three principal reasons students switch out of STEM majors: course work is too demanding, non-STEM disciplines appear more interesting, and job prospects are perceived to be better elsewhere. Five year-long programs for first-year students are being implemented to combat attrition. A student's engagement with KEYSTONE begins with a personalized invitation to join the project. During the mandatory new student orientations, STEM students are attending a new session on the special academic experiences designed for them. During the academic year, STEM students are participating in (i) a STEM-focused First-Year Seminar class, (ii) project and experiment-based courses in the January term, (iii) a STEM-specific, one-semester-hour STEMinar in the spring term to reinforce the developing STEM learning communities, and to introduce students, in a discussion-based format, to relevant professionals and career options, (iv) a one-semester-hour spring term class to prepare students for summer research, and (v) a summer research experience for a subset of the rising sophomores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The KEYSTONE interventions are anchored in the research literature and represent current effective practices. They, in combination with synergistic activities on campus, are contributing to a transformation of the undergraduate research culture of Elmhurst College. The project is being evaluated for both formative and summative purposes with data being collected to guide the project and to determine the efficacy of the specific interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The KEYSTONE project is broadening participation in STEM careers by actively combating attrition, by utilizing known interventions that are particularly effective for students at-risk or from underrepresented groups. Several of the interventions are being designed and implemented to ensure long-term sustainability. The project is increasing the number of students graduating with STEM degrees through strategic advising, monitoring, and engagement of first-year students. The project's success is articulating a model program that could be adopted or adapted by many other institutions.</AbstractNarration>
