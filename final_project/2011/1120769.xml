    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Conference on Eukaryotic Transcription will be held August 30- September 3, 2011 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. This meeting is a central forum for the presentation of new results in eukaryotic transcription. Participants will represent laboratories throughout the world, and most attendees will present either short talks or posters. The breadth of the conference makes it an important focus for the exchange of information in this era of scientific specialization. Topics for the meeting will include: 1) Global Regulation of Transcription, 2) Transcription Initiation Mechanisms of Pol I, II &amp; III, 3) Coactivator Complexes and Activation Mechanisms, 4) Transcription Elongation and Termination Mechanisms, 5) Chromatin and Transcription, 6) Regulation of Transcription Factor Activity, 7) Signaling and Regulatory Mechanisms, and 8) Transcriptional Regulation in Development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The meeting will provide an outstanding opportunity for participation by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and for those from underrepresented groups. For many, this is the first large meeting at which they have an opportunity to speak, and the highly interactive nature of the meeting allows young scientists to meet and talk to the senior scientists they know from the literature. Thus, it plays a vital role in building scientific networks.</AbstractNarration>
