    <AbstractNarration>This dissertation will describe and analyze undocumented aspects of the grammar of Anii, a Kwa language with approximately 46,000 speakers, spoken along the border of Togo and Benin, West Africa. Original data will be collected from speakers of the Bassila dialect of Anii in order to answer outstanding descriptive and theoretical questions that have arisen from very limited previous research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anii is classified as a Kwa language, specifically a member of a small group of languages called Ghana-Togo Mountain (GTM) languages, and has only one possible close relative. Thus, the study of Anii will shed light on a very under-studied branch of the Kwa family. Areas of focus for this project include a description of the tonal system of Anii, investigation of sound patterns, especially regarding vowels, a description of clausal syntax, and work on the semantics of the Anii verbal system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since Anii is virtually undescribed, the data to be gathered will contribute to empirical knowledge of the world's languages and allow for the testing of theories that were developed using data from more well-known languages. In addition, the project will support grassroots literacy efforts in the Anii language to help many illiterate adults learn to read for the first time and give many children easier access to education (through envisioned Anii to French transition programs in local schools). An important step for these literacy programs is developing an orthography that includes tone, and the tonal analysis to be undertaken for this dissertation research is key to the success of this endeavor. This project will also aid in the preservation of the Anii language and culture and encourage the Anii people to have pride in their linguistic heritage through collecting texts for the staff of a new Anii-language magazine.</AbstractNarration>
