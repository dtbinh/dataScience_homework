    <AbstractNarration>Recent technological advances have enabled digital applications to move away from purely desktop and office settings to gain greater relevance in our everyday lives and spaces: homes, classrooms, public and cultural places, scientific laboratories and beyond. This has given rise to an increasing number of creative practices and research areas that seek to overcome the long-standing separation between the physical and digital worlds. The ACM Conference on Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction (TEI) serves as a gathering place for an interdisciplinary community of computer scientists, engineers, artists and designers working in the emerging field of new interfaces that bridge the physical and virtual worlds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is in support of the third annual TEI 2012 Graduate Student Consortium, to be held at the ACM TEI 2012 at Queen's University in Ontario, Canada. The ACM TEI 2012 Graduate Student Consortium will promote national and international exchange of research, methods and ideas at the intersection of this diverse field of engineering and creativity. The consortium is an opportunity to develop the research and design skills of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and designers who will shape the technological and socio-cultural landscape of the future of computing as it integrates physical objects and virtual spaces seamlessly. The consortium program aims to increase participation in the tangible, embedded and embodied interaction academic community by providing mentorship for young scientists, researchers, and designers in this field, and by giving them the opportunity to meet and engage with more senior TEI researchers at the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students from a range of fields, including industrial design, digital media arts, human centered computing and computer science will convene and share research projects that will help to broaden their perspectives on transformative practices and methods in the field. Consortium participants will be invited to present their work and receive constructive critique from a panel of faculty mentors. And, they will present their work in a poster session during the conference, and their accompanying papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.</AbstractNarration>
