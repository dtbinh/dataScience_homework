    <AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to develop a portable platform to collect Global Positioning System - Acoustic (GPS-A) measurements to measuring seafloor deformation. The proposed system will be internally powered and autonomous, capable of collecting GPS-A data for a minimum of 24 hours while unattended. It will have two thrusters guided by GPS to automatically maintain its lateral position above an array of acoustic transponders on the sea floor. It will be portable, self-contained and deployable from a variety of vessels to open access to regions wherever there are ships-of-opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the Sumatra, Chile and Japan earthquakes the need for more knowledge and tools in this area/discipline is even more apparent. To further enable research in this area, new tools are required to engender new science. If successful, GEOSPAR will bring new knowledge on earth's active process both in research and education, as well as a view of disaster prevention against large earthquakes and resultant tsunami. Has direct impact upon science goals of four major NSF supported efforts: GeoPRISMS, the Cascadia Initiative, Earthscope, and the OOI cabled observatory (along the Cascadia Subduction Zone).</AbstractNarration>
