    <AbstractNarration>An International Collaboration in Chemistry (ICC) between two laboratories in the area of fluorine chemistry, one from the inorganic side - Professor Joseph Thrasher of Clemson University and the other from the organic side - Professor Günter Haufe of the University of Münster, Germany, funded by the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program of NSF's Chemistry Division (with contribution from the Office of International Science and Engineering) and its German counterpart the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), seeks to advance transformative research in the emerging field of pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5) chemistry. This research activity involves developing new or improved synthetic routes to key SF5-containing building blocks as well as using these building blocks to introduce the SF5 group into complex organic structures, energetic materials, and polymers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluorine has a prestigious position in many areas of organic chemistry with products involved in everyday life, e.g., medicinal and agrochemicals, as well as novel materials. The development of viable methods for the simple introduction of the SF5 group into organic compounds could enhance the likelihood of obtaining materials with improved performance in many areas of application. Broader impacts include the development of a pipeline of motivated, interested students prepared to undertake careers in STEM disciplines, particularly in the field of fluorine chemistry. Along with the scientific exchange, the cultural and language exchange during this research is expected to result in the dissemination of this work to the general public.</AbstractNarration>
