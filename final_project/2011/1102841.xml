    <AbstractNarration>A broad range of cosmological observations tells us that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of ordinary particles, but exists in some dark form. Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. Such particles would represent an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics, such as supersymmetry or additional dimensions. If WIMPs exist and are the dark matter, then their presence in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low-temperature phonon-mediated devices to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and to distinguish them from backgrounds. This award will provide funds for the base program of UCB to support the scientific aspects of this program in the following ways, fully coordinated with the CDMS collaboration: (a) scientific support of the SuperCDMS Soudan experiment (monitoring of Soudan operation, characterization of detector performance, reconstruction, and analysis); (b) contribution to the design of SuperCDMS SNOLAB (proof of concept of various detector configurations, detector testing, optimization of cold hardware and electronics); and (c) scientific support to SuperCDMS SNOLAB construction (SNOLAB production detector testing and characterization, cold hardware design validation, optimization of analysis methods to maximize efficiency).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This program's technological development will push the envelope of phonon-mediated detectors, whose applications are increasingly widespread. The project will contribute to the training of undergraduates, graduates, and research scientists. A formal mentoring structure of the research scientists is in place to help develop their scientific leadership and their career. Furthermore, within the SuperCDMS collaboration, the PI will continue to support the public outreach program at Soudan. At Berkeley, he will continue his support of Bay Area high school students from underserved communities through his successful contribution to the SMASH academy.</AbstractNarration>
