    <AbstractNarration>The challenges of sustainability span disciplines, and students prepared to address those challenges must be able to think critically across traditional content areas. In this project, faculty from the Chemistry Department and Sustainability Studies Program at Stony Brook University are collaboratively developing, implementing, and assessing learning materials for three undergraduate chemistry courses that focus on sustainability. The developed materials will address the chemistry of environmental processes, environmental degradation, energy production and the connections between chemistry-related and non-chemistry-related aspects of sustainability, such as economics and policy. Students will conduct meaningful research in the laboratory course by evaluating the effectiveness of solar-powered algal turf scrubbers to remove excess nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients from streams and coastal waters, as well as the suitability of using the resulting algal biomass as fertilizer. These represent potential abatement strategies for the coastal water quality problem of fertilizer run-off. Developed materials will employ inquiry based learning strategies using the POGIL model, and modern technology - simulation model exercises that guide students in understanding chemistry concepts and their connections to issues of sustainability will be created. Developed learning materials will be evaluated and disseminated through publications and presentations, and will be designed to be suitable for adoption at other institutions.</AbstractNarration>
