    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This three year REU site program at the Colorado School of Mines will engage 10 undergraduate students each year in research focused in the area of novel polymer materials related to cutting-edge technologies like fuel cells and solar materials. The overall objectives of the REU site program are: 1) engage and educate students in polymer science and engineering; 2) emphasize diversity in research teams with respect to experience (from faculty to freshmen, non-Ph.D. granting institutions, etc.), gender, and ethnicity; and 3) quantify successes of the program through assessment, including number of participants earning their Bachelors degrees; presentations at national and regional meetings, and publications in peer reviewed journals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique feature of this REU program is the exchange program which will allow the students to experience another research lab during the second half of the summer. Additionally, a series of technical workshops will provide the students with a broad introduction to polymer science and engineering. Furthermore, a complimentary set of workshops will cover professional skills development. At the end of each summer, the students will prepare and present posters on their research accomplishments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This REU site program will encompass research in polymer science and engineering while targeting highly qualified chemistry and chemical engineering students from diverse backgrounds. The student-learning outcomes of the project focus on engaging and creating enthusiasm for science and engineering. The research has direct ramification to the Army's fuel cell program. The proposed REU site program will target highly qualified chemistry and chemical engineering students from diverse backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
