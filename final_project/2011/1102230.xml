    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to investigate nanoelectrode nanopore DNA sequencing devices combined with a hybrid approach that measures the electrical response of the devices to short hybridized DNA sequences. The intellectual merit is to investigate a new approach to DNA sequencing that has a strong theoretical basis but needs to be developed experimentally. The proposed research will test well-developed hypotheses that DNA can be sequenced by transverse tunneling measurements. The first hypothesis is that transverse tunneling is sensitive to specific nucleotides and that sequences of nucleotides can be detected in nanoelectrode tunneling devices. The second hypothesis relaxes the need for single base resolution by using short probes that hybridize with DNA. These labeled strands are proposed to give rise to significant fluctuations of the tunneling current in nanopore devices. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are to discover a new type of low cost DNA sequencing device that enables new medical applications for the benefit of the general public. The successful discovery of low cost nanodevices for DNA sequencing would be transformative for personalized genomics by greatly expanding our ability to study, diagnose, and treat disease. A successful outcome of the research will have a tremendous impact on healthcare world-wide by facilitating wide-spread DNA sequencing technology. The research will also foster outreach to the general public to disseminate information about the potential benefits and ethical risks of genome sequencing technology. Other broader impacts include impacts on graduate and undergraduate education and summer outreach activities to high school students, including underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
