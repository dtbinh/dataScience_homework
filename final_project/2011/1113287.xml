    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores the technical, instructional and commercial viability of Augmented Reality applications for K-12 science education. Research indicates that learning science in context increases student involvement and makes data meaningful. The opportunity is to further deepen the learning experience using emerging AR technology. This proposal is led by Imaginary Lines, a small, woman-owned business. The Phase I research will answer questions regarding technical implementation, usability, instructional design and commercial potential by developing and assessing prototypes that display real-time measurements in a background scene with increasingly sophisticated Augmented Reality. The research plan includes: Technical Evaluation of implemented features to assess reliability and robustness; Design Evaluation, to review functionality with users (students and teachers), gauge expectations, and identify delivery approaches that resonate; Usability Testing of prototype activities to assess product use; Instructional Evaluation, to gauge the appeal and instructional value; and Suitability Testing, to assess reactions to the concept and to specific implementations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts/commercial potential of this project result because the proposed product brings a technology to K-12 education that could transform the way students imagine, learn and interact with science. Augmented Reality appeals strongly to students, puts science in real-world context and stimulates independent exploration. The product would deliver standards-based science content in a richly engaging, personal and contextual way. It promises broad benefits, including instructional benefits, by teaching science in context; and societal benefits, by developing 21st century skills in tomorrow?s workforce. Augmented Reality is projected to reach the education market by 2014. This product could be first to market with Augmented Reality applications for science education. Today's students are growing up with Augmented Reality; it will be how they naturally assimilate information and explore their world. The product's competitive advantage is that it presents real data as part of the student?s world in a way that the student will (by then) be accustomed; its transformative nature charts a path to even further innovation.</AbstractNarration>
