    <AbstractNarration>This project provides scholarships to able and financially needy students majoring in the sciences and mathematics. The project is open to all students who meet academic and financial eligibility requirements and emphasizes supporting students, especially first-generation college students and members of groups underrepresented in the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The academic programs into which the students go are strong, and there are academic support activities. Students are being attracted to the scholarships through family-based recruitment practices, collaboration with local high schools, and partnerships with local nonprofit agencies. Retention and graduation rates are being increased by a summer bridge program, an orientation program, supplemental instruction in key STEM courses, intensive academic advising, and summer research and internship opportunities. Professional success is encouraged through regular group meetings, individualized portfolios, and career services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project is increasing the number and diversity of students who complete a STEM major and go on to work in the field or to further education. Results of this program are being disseminated through professional conferences and higher education publications and shared with partner high schools. Successful support structures built for these students are being incorporated into the college's programs.</AbstractNarration>
