    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1123052 PI: Mefford, O. Thompson ORG: Clemson University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Symposium -- Frontiers in Biomagnetic Particles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: It is proposed to conduct a three-day symposium on the characterization and control of magnetic particles. They have a variety of uses in therapeutic and diagnostic applications relevant to the Biomaterials program. The funds will be used to support travel awards for graduate students, postdoctorals students, and faculty, including those from underrepresented groups. Magnetic carriers are unique nano-materials with a wide range of biomedical, environmental, and technological impacts. This event will bring scientists, engineers, medical professionals, and program managers together to discuss this rapidly growing and highly interdisciplinary field. Magnetic particles are an enabling technology for a wide variety of biomedical, chemical, electronic, and functional materials research, because they provide a unique handle to manipulate and sense nanostructures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: Funding from NSF will be used to support financial assistance to early-stage researchers who may otherwise be unable to attend this meeting. Funding priority will be given to graduate students attending their first national meeting, junior faculty giving an oral presentation, and researchers belonging to underrepresented groups. The existence of potential funding for student travel will be described in advertisements for the symposium to enhance student interest. In addition, both organizers of this meeting are junior faculty in the early stages of their careers. Because this field benefits especially well from cross-fertilization of ideas from chemistry, biology, physics, and engineering, the symposium will create a technical and social environment in which participants from diverse disciplines can discuss trends in research and form fruitful collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
