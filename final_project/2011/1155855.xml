    <AbstractNarration>Ethane and propane are released in abundance to the ocean through natural seepage, as byproducts of photosynthesis, and by the petroleum industry. For example, ethane and propane together constituted greater than 5% of the total mass release during the Deepwater Horizon event and were the primary drivers of oxygen decline in the deep waters of the NE Gulf of Mexico during the spill. Despite the importance of these gases, little is known about their release into the ocean, the capacity of marine bacteria to consume them, or the fate and impacts of the carbon and energy they store. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project researchers at the University of California at Santa Barbara will specifically address the consumption of ethane and propane in the ocean by developing, validating and applying highly sensitive tracer techniques to quantify consumption rates for these gases in ocean waters. Two specific hypotheses will be tested with the goal to better understand the factors controlling ethane and propane consumption in the ocean. Hypothesis 1: The capacity for ethane and propane oxidation is ubiquitous throughout the upper ocean and along continental margins, with constitutive rates that depend on regional input and total bacterial abundance; Hypothesis 2: Propane and ethane consumption are readily inducible beyond a basal level on the timescale of days, propane consumption more so than ethane consumption. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will address these hypotheses in two steps. The first step will entail the development of a method to quantify the consumption rates for ethane and propane, including the laboratory synthesis of radiolabeled ethane and propane, purification of the products, systematic investigations of tracer storage to minimize effects of autoradiolytic exchange, and validation of the measurement through intercomparison. The second step is the application of the method to interrogate the rates of ethane and propane consumption in the ocean, including the coastal ocean and along the continental margin off California. The field component of the research will take place during a series of short cruises in the Santa Barbara Basin, and during one value added cruise aboard a UNOLS vessel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts This project will provide support for the dissertation research of one graduate student. Several undergraduate students will receive laboratory training and participate in the coastal research. A field studies course will bring several undergraduates on a research expedition and provide them a rich hands-on educational experience, truly integrating teaching and research, using an established methodology. The PI will continue to lead outreach efforts by example, serving as a resource to journalists, federal agencies, and members of Congress, and through popularization of appropriate aspects of this research</AbstractNarration>
