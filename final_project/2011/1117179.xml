    <AbstractNarration>This proposal explores a robust quantum cryptography protocol for securing optical burst switching (OBS) networks, providing a means to make the OBS-based future Internet trustworthy from the ground up. Since the OBS network has a one-to-one correspondence between the header and its associated burst, the same relationship can be exploited for encryption. The quantum-based methodology makes it possible to distribute keys securely so that each burst is encrypted and decrypted with a unique key. As the well-known BB84 quantum cryptography protocol is susceptible to siphoning attacks on the multiple photons emitted by practical sources, we use a new 3-stage quantum cryptography protocol which is immune to such siphoning attacks, for it is based on random rotations of the polarization vector. The new 3-stage quantum cryptography protocol allows practical photon sources to be used in the quantum key exchange, making it feasible to extend quantum cryptography services beyond trusted routers. The 3-stage all quantum protocol is being investigated for its performance in different noise situations for different key generation rates. The implementation of the protocol uses quantum phase modulation rather than polarization modulation which is not stable in the long transmission over fiber. The research conducted in this proposal includes the design of an integrated secure router and investigation of quantum cryptography protocols for specific services. This research will be verified on a reconfigurable optical burst switching test bed.</AbstractNarration>
