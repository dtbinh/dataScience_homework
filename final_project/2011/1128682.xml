    <AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object of this research is to investigate the use of metal and dielectric nanostructures to enable, via optical scattering, improved absorption in thin-film solar cells, and to explore applications in terrestrial and aerospace photovoltaic systems. The approach is based on GaAs/InGaAs/InAs quantum well-based heterostructure solar cells, which have been postulated to offer maximum power conversion efficiencies of ~45% to over 60%. Use of metal and dielectric nanostructures for scattering and light trapping within devices will enable absorption efficiency to be improved over selected wavelength ranges in very thin device layers. The University of Texas at Austin and Boeing will collaborate in exploring both basic device physics and photovoltaic system applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental issues in the physics, design, and fabrication of quantum-well and related multiband solar cells will be elucidated. Understanding of the interaction between metal and dielectric nanostructures and semiconductor devices, particularly with regard to the design of nanophotonic structures and achieving control over photon propagation and absorption within thin-film semiconductors, will be advanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work could have a major impact on renewable power generation, particularly in concentrating photovoltaic systems, and could advance a broad range of device concepts in which semiconductor, metal, and dielectric nanostructures are integrated. Introduction of freshman electrical engineering students to photovoltaics and solar energy, senior-level design projects, and university-industrial collaboration will provide a broad range of students with exposure to state of the art energy technology and provide a path for rapid technology transfer.</AbstractNarration>
