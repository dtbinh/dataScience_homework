    <AbstractNarration>The University of California, Hastings College of the Law ADVANCE PAID project is a partnership with the Association for Women in Science (AWIS) that focuses on the development and dissemination of workshop tools and modules to institutions of higher education. These tools are expected to accomplish several critical objectives including, providing institutions with economic data that builds the case for gender equity policies; development and dissemination of knowledge associated with underrepresented minority women; implementation of user friendly workshops-in-a-box; improvement and dissemination of survey protocols and related products; and, leveraging of multiple and easily accessible outlets for dissemination of relevant information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The UC Hastings project is a strategic partnership with a national organization that has a complementary focus on enhancing the representation of women in the academic STEM disciplines. With the broad network of AWIS and the expertise of the PIs, this partnership will utilize a train-the-trainer model to provides workshops-in-a-box, develop a rigorous economic analysis of retaining women in the academy, determine mechanisms for disaggregating gender bias by race and/or ethnicity and provide meaningful tools for change dissemination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The proposed project is expected to reach beyond higher education to include other AWIS chapters and non-profit STEM organizations. As such, there are significant broader impacts associated with the workshops. Additionally, by utilizing the national platform of AWIS, traditional means of dissemination are broadened to the greatest extent possible. Thus, the outcomes of the project that are related to women in STEM will easily reach a broad audience and contribute to engaging both institutions of higher education and STEM organizations in best practices related to promoting gender equity.</AbstractNarration>
