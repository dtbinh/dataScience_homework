    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the electrochemical co-deposition processing of a conductive nanocomposite of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and copper (Cu) which promises to have ultrahigh electrical and thermal conductivity. The primary goal of the work is to understand the fabrication process of the Cu and CNT-based composite and to optimize the fabrication parameters in terms of raw material selection and deposition control parameters. The process study will address the selection of the type of CNT, the treatment of the CNTs and the distribution of CNTs within copper matrix. Characterization will include measuring the electrical and thermal conductivities, nano/microstructure observation with electron microscopy and mechanical strength testing. The fundamental mechanism for the enhanced conduction in the material system will be studied as a function of the process parameters and resulting nano/microstructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the new copper-based material system would significantly impact energy usage in electric motors, power generators and heat exchangers through its improved conductivity. In general terms, the results of this research will lead to improvement in the design and fabrication process of metallic composites by utilizing carbon nanotubes to achieve desired material properties. The results will provide ways to minimize the production times and thus reduce the cost to produce metal/carbon nanotube composites. The proposed work will also contribute to student training through curriculum renovation and participation in the research. The investigator also participates in an annual Nano-Camp which teaches high school students about nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
