    <AbstractNarration>EarthScope science investigations depend on the three EarthScope facilities for geophysical data acquisition: San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth, Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), and the transportable seismic and magnetotelluric Observatory (USArray). PBO has an established presence in Alaska since 2004, while USArray is anticipated starting in 2014, following its deployment on the East Coast. Other NSF programs will be supporting related research efforts in Alaska in the coming years, in particular the GeoPRISMS program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coming deployment of the USArray transportable seismic array to Alaska provides a timely prompt for a broad scientific community to discuss scientific opportunities and goals that can be addressed using data from EarthScope facilities and other sources. These and related topics will be discussed by a broad group of scientists at a workshop organized in conjunction with the 2011 EarthScope National Meeting in Austin, Texas. Convening the workshop at this time will draw a large group at a minimal cost, compared to a stand-alone workshop. The workshop presentations and discussions will help inform the US earth science community about new scientific opportunities, and will provide recommendations based on scientific needs about the future deployment and operation of EarthScope facilities in Alaska.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary products of the workshop will include a workshop report, a of 1-page white papers solicited from all attendees, a set of recommendations for EarthScope facilities in Alaska, and an updated website for EarthScope Science in Alaska, with explicit connections to all related efforts, such as GeoPRISMS and the Cascadia Initiative.</AbstractNarration>
