    <AbstractNarration>1161543&lt;br/&gt;Catalano&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of an x-ray diffractometer to support geoscience research and research training that requires the capability for rapid phase identification of fine grained crystalline and polycrystalline materials and crystallographic structure refinements for studies of phase transformations and vacancy substitutions. The instrument will replace an aging (30 yrs old) and obsolete XRD in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. The instrument will serve the research and training needs of multiple faculty at across seven departments at WASH-SL. The lead PIs early career research will immediately benefit from a new XRD for studies of low temperature mineralization and alteration of iron oxides and studies of phyllomanganates, ferrous smectites and uranium phosphates with implications for understanding contaminant fate in aquatic systems. The instrument will support extant PI educational activities including undergraduate training and High-school intern activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
