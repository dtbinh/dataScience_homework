    <AbstractNarration>Full Center Proposal (Phase II) for an I/UCRC for the Connection One Center for Radio Frequency Systems &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1134641 Ohio State University (OSU); John Volakis &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Connection One site at the Ohio State University is proposing a Phase II support (second five-year period) for the Center, including support for central personnel, evaluation and research. The center is currently comprised of the Arizona State University (lead), the University of Arizona, the University of Hawaii, and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as research partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this Phase II Ohio State University proposal is to build on and continue its successful Phase I effort as part of the "Connection One: Communications Circuits and Systems Center" (C1 Center) already funded by the National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Program. The Ohio State University adds unique capabilities to the C1 Center for two reasons: (1) Has an established large program in Electromagnetics, RFICs and Radio Frequency Systems with over 120 graduate students and nearly 15 undergrads; (2) Extensive experimental facilities for antennas, RFICs, systems-on-a-chip testing and evaluation, polymer and ceramics fabrication, LTCC screen printing, terahertz imaging up to 3THz, and remote sensing. A recent State of Ohio $3M grant for terahertz equipment will be leveraged during Phase II as well. Ohio State will substantially increase the visibility and activity of the C1 NSF Center by focusing on measurements and system design activities (passive and active component integration for multifunctional all-in-one devices for high data rates). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed site will focus on training students in a truly interdisciplinary arena for research in integrated communications systems, critical to many U.S. industries. The inherent aim of the Center is to integrate industry needs with University research and provide hands-on student experiences in a well-developed and supported laboratory setting for RFIC hardware, 4G wireless, coding and signal processing techniques, software radios/radars and MIMO technologies, RFIDs, new materials and metamaterials, sensors and sensor networks to mention a few. Collaborative projects with other universities within the C1 Center are another key aspect of the proposed site. The Ohio State University site has maintained from 7 to 10 industry and government members over the term of its phase I award, and has had success during its phase 1 award in the training of students through newly developed course work and the center's research.</AbstractNarration>
