    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Office of International Science and Engineering will support Professor Craig Hill and his coworkers at Emory University to work in conjunction with Professor Lee Cronin at the University of Glasgow in the UK to develop catalysts for the visible-light-driven reduction of water to dihydrogen and the construction of a new type of multifunctional, high-surface-area microtube composed of photosensitizer cations and polyoxometalate (POM) catalysts. UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) will support the research of Professor Cronin and his coworkers. New photocathodes modified with these microtubes will be constructed for the efficient photogeneration of dihydrogen. Interactions between photosensitizer ruthenium cations and POM catalysts will be studied in both solution and the solid state. The prosecution of this research requires instruments and nano- and microfabrication infrastructure and materials characterization techniques present in the UK laboratory. Equipment and knowledge for photocatalysis and mechanistic investigations in Professor Hill's laboratory will be shared with the UK laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New materials for the photogeneration of hydrogen from water and sunlight will be developed using ruthenium photosensitizer cations and polyoxometalate catalysts. The research will train young scholars in the technical, intellectual and practical challenges associated with green energy chemistry together with the catalysis, materials, and spectroscopic aspects of solar fuels research. Investigators and students at Historically Black College and Universities and Primarily Undergraduate Institutions will be invited to attend group meetings and annual conferences.</AbstractNarration>
