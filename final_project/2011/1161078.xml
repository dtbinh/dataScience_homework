    <AbstractNarration>The project aims to further develop the connection between the fast developing area of Borel equivalence relations and forcing theory within the broader context of set theory and mathematical analysis. The driving idea is contained in the book "Canonical Ramsey Theory on Polish Spaces", coauthored by the PI, to appear in 2013. Given a Borel or analytic equivalence relation on a Polish space, is it possible to find a large subset of the space on which the equivalence is as simple as possible? Here, the largeness is to be interpreted in the sense of some sigma-ideal on the space, and the simplicity in the sense of the Borel reducibility rating of complexity of equivalence relations. This question, stated in terms similar to canonical Ramsey theory, uncovers a broad landscape indexed by sigma-ideals and equivalence relations, generalizing such results as the Proemel-Voigt theorem on canonization of smooth equivalence relations on Ramsey cubes, or Blass theorem on canonization of analytic graphs on perfect sets. The overarching general theme is a correspondence between Borel equivalence relations and models of set theory. The applications include nonreducibility results with the strongest possible statements and Silver type theorems for various sigma-ideals encountered in mathematical analysis. The project offers numerous other offshoots as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project follows the general theme of classification of equivalence problems in mathematics. Most areas of mathematics start with a class of objects and a notion of similarity between them. It is often of paramount importance to that branch of mathematics to evaluate the complexity of that notion of similarity. It turns out that there is a natural rating of complexity of such similarity problems that ties together most branches of (infinitary) mathematics. In order to evaluate the complexity correctly within this rating, one needs, among other things, tools for showing that one such notion of similarity is not reducible to another. The project offers a novel way for doing that: certain notions of similarity greatly simplify when one is allowed to restrict attention to a smaller, but still significant, class of objects--while others do not. Results of this type may not have immediate practical applications, but they do help with the understanding of methodology of mathematics. As is typical for this field, they also tie the fabric of mathematics closer together, showing that concerns of one field may reduce to questions solved by another field.</AbstractNarration>
