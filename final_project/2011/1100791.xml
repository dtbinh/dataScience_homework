    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to study the structural and functional changes of elastin due to in vitro elastin lipid interactions and glycation. As one of the major structural proteins of the body, elastin is essential to accommodate physiological deformation and provide elastic support for blood vessels. Elastin is remarkably long lived, but it can suffer damage from the cumulative effects of chemical exposure. End products or side chain modifications resulting from elastin lipid interactions and glycation compromise the mechanical properties of elastin by altering elastin's mobility. Changes in the elastic and viscoelastic properties of aortic elastin due to the effects of immediate biochemical environments will be studied. The molecular basis of possible intra- and extrafibrillar compartment changes will be explored using Raman and FT-IR microspectroscopy. A multi-scale mechanobiological constitutive model will be created to incorporate the effects of mechanical loading and biochemical environment in predicting the macroscopic elastic and viscoelastic properties of elastin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from these studies will advance our understanding of the role of elastin mechanics in vascular remodeling. Changes in the mechanical properties of elastin have important medical and physiological consequences. Many pathological conditions involve significant remodeling of elastin and thus altered mechanical and physiochemical functions of tissues. Knowledge of the relationship between molecular level alterations and elastin's mechanical functionality is integral to understanding its performance in living biological systems. The broad interdisciplinary nature of this project will greatly benefit the undergraduate/graduate students trained through this project. Research results will be disseminated through journal publications and conference presentations, and will also be incorporated into undergraduate/graduate teaching. We plan to integrate several engineering activities into the outreach programs at Boston University. The goal is to help young women students build self-confidence and a love for science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
