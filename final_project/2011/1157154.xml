    <AbstractNarration>The symposium on Comparative Proteomics of Environmental and Pollution Stress is the first of its kind to address global changes at the protein level in organisms, in response to environmental stressors. Investigating global patterns of protein abundance, also called proteomics, provides insights into the functional responses of cells to environmentally stressful conditions. The symposium will feature the few proteomic analyses currently being done on non-model or marine model organisms, and will bring together a range of participants, from students and post-docs to senior researchers, to present the latest research results, discuss implications, and exchange methodological and experimental approaches. Symposium participants will submit their presentations as manuscripts to Integrative and Comparative Biology for publication, which will help to distribute the research results to a wide audience and thus facilitate the growth of a research community interested in pursuing proteomic analyses to address problems in environmental and pollution stress biology.</AbstractNarration>
