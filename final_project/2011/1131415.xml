    <AbstractNarration>Methanol is an atmospheric volatile organic compound that contributes significantly to ozone production in the trophosphere. It has been thought that the ocean is a sink for methanol but recent studies suggest that ocean production of methanol could be important and that it exists in measurable quantities in surface ocean waters. Studies by the PI, from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, have recently shown that various genera of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton are capable of producing methanol. It is therefore hypothesized that methanol production by phytoplankton is a conserved phenomenon and that it comprises a significant portion of the photosynthetically fixed carbon in the marine environment. The PI proposes to use laboratory culture experiments to further elucidate what fraction of primary productivity is as methanol production, whether there is a diel cycle of production, and if it is stored or consumed or exuded from the microorganisms. The project will also examine the consumption of methanol as a carbon and energy source for microorganisms in the euphotic zone, and how environmental conditions affect this. Studies will involve both laboratory and field experiments. Methods developed by the PI will allow direct measurement of the rate of respiration, and the overall turnover rates of methanol in contrasting coastal and oligotrophic open ocean regimes. Results from this work will improve our understanding of the mechanisms controlling production and consumption of methanol, possibly a major fraction of dissolved organic matter that has been previously overlooked. The proposed project with fund a young investigator, contribute to student training at various levels and include outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
