    <AbstractNarration>Parallel programming is in crisis: its difficulty dissuades all but the most determined (and deep-pocketed)&lt;br/&gt;software vendors, and speedups are often disappointing for all but regular programs. Merely augmenting&lt;br/&gt;the substantial knowledge-base of parallel computing with incremental ideas in algorithms, programming&lt;br/&gt;languages, compilers, hardware, power or applications, interesting as they may be, is unlikely to change&lt;br/&gt;this reality.&lt;br/&gt;This project advances a powerful idea for drastically improving ease-of-programming within the context of&lt;br/&gt;a holistic many-core research architecture called XMT. Our contention is that without the co-design of&lt;br/&gt;language and architecture, one cannot conquer the twin challenges of easy programming and efficient&lt;br/&gt;parallelization of irregular programs. Therefore we are developing a new easy-to-program language&lt;br/&gt;called ICE as part of ecosystem consisting of XMT, the PRAM algorithmic model, and ICE, that together&lt;br/&gt;deliver on this twin goal. The XMT architecture, developed at UMD over the last decade, is capable of&lt;br/&gt;exploiting fine-grained parallelism in irregular programs. ICE is based on the successful PRAM algorithm&lt;br/&gt;model, which provides a rich theory for parallel programming, and has led to published parallel algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for hundreds of problems.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project includes (i) much easier parallel programming model leading to more&lt;br/&gt;succinct and intuitive code; (ii) freeing the programmer of many complex issues in parallel programming,&lt;br/&gt;leading to greater productivity and acceptance of parallel programming; (iii) the nearness of ICE and&lt;br/&gt;PRAM means that programmers would instantly have a rich ?library? of parallel algorithms without having&lt;br/&gt;to write their own; (iv) a language especially suitable to an architecture that has demonstrated&lt;br/&gt;unprecedented speedups on hard-to-parallelize irregular applications; and (v) a very active outreach&lt;br/&gt;program that has already seen XMT being used at many research and educational institutions.</AbstractNarration>
