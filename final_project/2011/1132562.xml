    <AbstractNarration>Through the "Learning Progressions Footprint Conference," leading researchers in science and mathematics education are bringing together leaders in the field for a workshop - to take place in Washington, DC, in July, 2011 - that will enable them to take stock of the progress of learning progressions research to date and to suggest productive directions for future research and development. The year 2011 promises to be a watershed year in science and mathematics education as many important developments are currently taking place that will shape mathematics and science education for years to come. In particular, new national standards are under development in both mathematics and science education, with revisions in state standards and assessments to follow. Learning progressions are informing Common Core standards and assessments for mathematics and are expected to play a central role in the conceptual framework for new National Science Education Standards. As new standards and assessments are introduced to the field, it will be critical (a) to assess current standards and contributions of learning progressions research, and (b) to turn attention to research on how to support implementation of practices and related products and technologies informed by a learning progressions perspective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning progressions research seeks to establish empirically grounded accounts of the development of students' scientific and mathematical knowledge and practice over broad spans of time, and of the instructional means of support that enable that development. Well-grounded learning progressions or learning trajectories can serve as valuable resources for science and mathematics education researchers, developers of standards documents, assessment developers, and curriculum developers. A critical evaluation of learning progressions research at this time is enabling the field to set priorities and invest resources wisely. The conference is framed to focus on these issues and is to be attended by about 40 leading researchers, developers, and practitioners in mathematics and science education, as well as representatives of NSF and other federal agencies. In preparation for the conference, participants are considering five key questions:&lt;br/&gt; 1. What is the important work that has taken place over the last 20 years? How strong is the evidence base and how can it be strengthened?&lt;br/&gt; 2. What are learning progressions good for? How have they been used in practice, and with what consequences? What additional uses might they legitimately have?&lt;br/&gt; 3. What methodological advances have been made in learning progressions work? To what extent are current standards of evidence adequate and where are further refinements needed?&lt;br/&gt; 4. How can we develop the interdisciplinary teams, possibly including potential users, to do this type of work?&lt;br/&gt; 5. What recommendations do conference members have for policies and priorities for future learning progressions work?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The products of the conference will include: (a) a conference report that assesses the evidence base around learning progressions, evaluates methodological approaches, and considers implications for policy and practice, (b) proposals for sessions at professional conferences, and (c) position papers to be submitted to journals for publication.</AbstractNarration>
