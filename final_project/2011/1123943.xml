    <AbstractNarration>The project will produce a reference grammar of Paresi, an endangered Southern Arawak language spoken by approximately 2000 people in the State of Mato Grosso (Brazil). The goals are to advance the linguistic understanding of Paresi and to document the Paresi language and culture by organizing an archive with audio, video and annotated texts of naturally occurring discourse. The grammar will contain a description of basic grammatical phenomena, with special attention to the unusual typological features of the language, for example, Paresi nominal classification system. The basis of the grammar will be the collection, transcription and analyses of a variety of texts. The methods to be used include the recording of natural conversation, observation of oral tradition with focus on storytelling, and direct elicitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grammar will serve as a reference for the production of materials for community language programs. The project will produce a resource not only to the scientific community but also to the Paresi communities by providing them with recordings of their cultural heritage and written texts which will help them to develop pedagogical materials. Speakers will be trained to document their rituals and cultural activities in audio and video. This project will contribute to the development of indigenous language study in Brazil and in United States. Due to the endangered status of Paresi, it is of crucial importance that we provide a descriptive grammar and corpus in order to systematically document the Paresi language and aspects of Paresi culture. The project will contribute to our understanding of the Arawak language family, for which few in-depth descriptions are currently available.</AbstractNarration>
