    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation grant supports the acquisition of an Applied Biosystems 3500 Genetic Analyzer to support research and undergraduate education at Texas A&amp;M International University (TAMIU), a Hispanic serving institution in South Texas. The acquisition of a genetic analyzer will enable the PI and students to collect sequence data and score a variety of molecular markers, which will facilitate the construction of phylogenies, determine the genetic structure of populations and provide a greater understanding of the neuroendocrine and transcriptional mechanisms underlying complex social behaviors. In addition to the PI's research program, the requested equipment will advance the projects of numerous faculty, both at TAMIU and surrounding colleges and universities. These faculty represent a great diversity of research disciplines, including: genetics, microbiology, soil science, environmental limnology, ecology, plant biology, and bioinformatics. Situated on the border in South Texas, TAMIU serves a predominately Hispanic community; a group historically underrepresented in science and math professions. Increasing the participation of these students in cutting edge original research is critical to broadening diversity in the sciences and enhancing the nation?s technological and economic competitiveness. Results from this research will be disseminated through regional and professional conferences, publications in scholarly journals, as well as communicated to the general public in interviews with the media, write-ups in lay publications, and lectures to non-professional societies. The equipment supported by this proposal will provide outstanding educational benefits to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students at TAMIU and the surrounding area, enhancing the current curriculum and fostering the creation new courses in genomics and bioinformatics.</AbstractNarration>
