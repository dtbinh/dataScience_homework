    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of this Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Integrating Nanotechnology into Undergraduate Engineering Education at the University of Arkansas", under the direction of Dr. Min Zou, are to 1) develop nanotechnology modules for freshman and sophomore classes; 2) develop a new laboratory to develop student skills with nanotechnology tools; 3) create a multidisciplinary nanotechnology certificate program; and 4) increase the number of undergraduate students participating in undergraduate research. The proposed plan creatively and effectively integrates interdisciplinary nanotechnology education into undergraduate engineering curriculum in the College of Engineering (COE) at the University of Arkansas (UA). Members of the project team are from different departments in the COE and the College of Arts and Sciences, forming an interdisciplinary team that gives the students the broadest exposure to nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this program is in the development and implementation of an increased learning environment in nanotechnology for the next generation of scientists and engineers who will lead discovery at the nanoscale. Almost all UA COE undergraduate students will be exposed to nanotechnology education starting at the freshman level and a significant portion of them will participate in research in nanotechnology. The proposed plan has the potential to serve as a model for other mid-size graduate institutions that wish to impact the education of undergraduate engineering students in areas of emerging technology.</AbstractNarration>
