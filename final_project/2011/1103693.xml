    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2011, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Talline Martins is "Genetic basis and evolution of petal pigmentation patterns in Clarkia." The host institution is Duke University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Mark Rausher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most striking morphological characters organisms have evolved is ornamentation based on a multitude of pigmentation patterns. For example, pollinators are attracted to specific leaf and flower patterns of plants. These traits and their repeated evolution implicate pigmentation patterns as powerful drivers of evolution by natural selection. Yet, the genetic bases underlying patterning have been described in less than a handful of cases. This research investigates how members of the genus Clarkia produce one such pattern, petal spots. It surveys and compares all genes that are active in developing petals, known as the floral transcriptome, in several closely-related species. The result is a comprehensive map of the genetic, molecular, and biochemical interactions that led to the formation and diversification of this ecologically important trait. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include a range of genetic, genomic, and informatics techniques to explore the biological network that gives rise to pigmentation patterns in flowers. Broader impacts include increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities at the postdoctoral level, as well as at the undergraduate and high-school levels, through mentoring activities and outreach efforts.</AbstractNarration>
