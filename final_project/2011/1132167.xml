    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of this workshop are to identify and study the key difficulties and set an agenda for advanced research in the mathematical modeling and simulation of complex service systems that involve uncertainty. This includes health-care systems, emergency systems (ambulances, police, fire fighting, natural disasters, etc.), logistic and delivery systems, transportation systems, telephone call centers, communication networks, and so on. The aim is to develop appropriate mathematical models that account for the uncertainty in these systems, develop simulation tools based on those models, and develop algorithms and software to optimize or improve the design and management of those systems using simulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large and complex service systems have enormous importance for the well-being of our communities. Yet the design and management of those systems is a very difficult talk, mainly because of their high complexity and the large amount of uncertainty that they involve. Stochastic models and computer-based simulation are appropriate tools for this task, but developing sufficiently realistic and reliable models is still at the research stage. The workshop will serve to identify the most important and relevant research issues for the modeling, simulation, and management of service systems. It will expose researchers and students to multiple perspectives on complex systems in a range of application areas, foster exchanges of expertise and new research collaborations across those areas, and set an agenda for future research. A special issue of a highly-ranked scientific journal on stochastic simulation will be devoted to selected contributions from this workshop. Presentations will also be made available on the internet after the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
