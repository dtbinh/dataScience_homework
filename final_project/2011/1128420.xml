    <AbstractNarration>SES - 1128420&lt;br/&gt;Leah VanWey (PI)&lt;br/&gt;Peter Klein (co-PI)&lt;br/&gt;Brown University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral Dissertation Research: Civil Society and Environmental Governance in Brazil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how small cities balance global environmental concerns with local needs for economic growth. It seeks to answer three main questions: 1) What are the differences in the ways federal governments and local governments talk about environmental problems and sustainable development solutions? 2) How are programs developed by international non-governmental organizations that seek to foster sustainable development adopted or transformed at the local level? 3) What role does participatory democracy on environmental issues play in shaping the success of such sustainable development programs? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Brazilian Amazon is one of the most critical places to examine this issue due to the adverse impacts deforestation can have on climate change as well as the subsequent consequences of global warming on the rich biodiversity of the area. Thus, this project investigates timely and politically sensitive issue in an empirically useful location. The study employs an explicitly comparative approach and involves ethnographic fieldwork in a mid-size city in the Brazilian Amazon, as well as in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Addressing global environmental degradation as well as economic development needs simultaneously has emerged as perhaps the most pressing challenge for the 21st century. Research on the local implementation of transnational sustainable development initiatives can inform policy makers and may provide insights useful to local, state, and transnational entities interested in developing effective and efficient policies. In addition, the international fieldwork component will help enhance collaboration between academic institutions across national and disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>
