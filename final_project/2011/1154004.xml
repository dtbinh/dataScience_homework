    <AbstractNarration>This project provides scholarships to able and financially needy students majoring in chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, and interdisciplinary fields. The project emphasizes supporting students through formal and informal interactions with faculty and among students, seminars, and an opportunity for dedicated funds for their thesis research project, covering supplies and/or travel, when they become seniors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The academic programs into which the students go are strong, and there are academic support activities. The project targets attrition between the first and second year of college, and it provides incentives for students to declare and remain in a STEM major. The project builds on a successful scholarship project that is just being completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project is increasing the number and diversity of students who complete a STEM major and go on to work in the field or to further education.</AbstractNarration>
