    <AbstractNarration>1158936/1158943 &lt;br/&gt;Atanassov/Minteer &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this Collaborative Project is the development of self-powered enzymatic biosensors using direct electron transfer between novel enzymes and novel nano-structured electrode materials. The self-powering is achieved by means of constructing a fuel cell with enzyme-catalyzed electrodes that generates response to the environmental change without the need of an external power source. The research plan is focused on improving selectivity and sensitivity of sensors utilizing inhibition and activation-based self-powered sensing. This is a multidisciplinary research project between University of Utah and University of New Mexico who will be working together in order to understand and develop the materials systems needed for self powered biosensors/biofuel cells. The two universities will utilize this interest to train high school students, undergraduate students, and graduate students in the interdisciplinary sciences of bio-electrochemistry, bio-nanotechnology, biosensing and bio-inspired energy conversion. The immediate involvement of students from underrepresented minorities is expected and will be aggressively sought.</AbstractNarration>
