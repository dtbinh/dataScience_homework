    <AbstractNarration>Phytoplankton primary production in estuarine ecosystems is often concentrated in distinct zones where high nutrient loads coincide with optimal conditions for phytoplankton growth. These zones are called chlorophyll maxima and produce a disproportionate amount of carbon for estuarine food webs. These areas are zones of high ecological importance because they can be used as indicators of estuarine condition and function. The focus of our study, the Neuse River Estuary (NRE), has a well defined chlorophyll maxima during the spring-fall. The NRE is highly affected by human activities, in particular excess nutrient input from agricultural and urban areas. The results of this research will provide baseline information about how these areas behave under future nutrient management, hydrologic (e.g., droughts, storms) and altered food web scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Estuaries are among the most productive, yet highly impacted ecosystems on Earth. The chlorophyll maxima is an important location in many temperate estuaries worldwide, thus our result will be applicable beyond our study system, the Neuse River estuary. Further knowledge of the behavior of this important feature will enhance our ability to better manage highly impacted estuarine ecosystems. This project will provide diverse educational opportunities for graduate students who will develop independent research projects. The NSF-supported Summer Pre-graduate Research Experience Program (SPGRE) at UNC-CH and regional universities educating under-represented groups will provide students for summer internships. Finally, high school students and teachers will be employed as interns during the summer field season, giving them a range of newfound experiences and knowledge to bring back to the classroom.</AbstractNarration>
