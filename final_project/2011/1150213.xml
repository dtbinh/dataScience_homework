    <AbstractNarration>Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation. Although a great deal of theoretical and applied biology rests on understanding the rate at which it occurs and its effects, few estimates exist and the variation among individuals, populations, and species is largely unknown. This project will quantify mutation rates and their effects on a genome-wide scale using Daphnia, a group of animals that has long served as a sentinel for population biology, community ecology, and environmental toxicology. The detailed analysis will include estimating mutation rates at multiple scales, including i) among the major categories of mutation which differ in their mechanistic causes, ii) between genomes (mitochondrial and nuclear), and iii) within and between species exhibiting different characteristics. It will be partnered with an analysis of measurable (phenotypic) effects of mutations on traits such as longevity, growth rate, and fecundity among these same groups and in variable environments. Special attention will be paid to a particularly exciting source of mutation in the genome-transposable elements. All biological and genomic resources developed will be made publicly available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Pursuing excellence in research and teaching is often seen as a trade-off, yet strategic approaches can enrich both endeavors. Knowledge gained from real-life scenarios and hands-on experience is often more compelling with longer lasting impact. These projects will be part of an integrative program of basic research (involving students, post-doctoral researchers, and collaborators), teaching and curriculum development (including the development of new courses and tutorials), and outreach (through domestic and international workshops, as well as public lectures). The benefits of this research include 1) deepening our understanding of key parameters in biology, 2) generating shared biological, genomic, and bioinformatic resources, 3) building science capacity through collaborating with the next generation of American and international scientists, and 4) educating the public about the central role of genetics, genomics, and evolution by sharing new discoveries as they occur.</AbstractNarration>
