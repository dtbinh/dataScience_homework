    <AbstractNarration>1160005/ Bentley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most successful examples of the new field of synthetic biology have come from imparting new capabilities into microorganisms for the production of unnatural products or products not typically made by those cells. Entire genomes are rearranged - at times to ensure the effects of product overproduction are tolerated by the producing cells (e.g., biofuels can inhibit producing cell growth). Generally, all cells act identically and optimally. In few examples are the cells themselves the "product" of synthetic biology. In an alternative view, individual cells can carry out high level functions. They can even direct other groups of cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivation of this work is to exploit the sensing and computational power of bacteria. More specifically, a new biological switch that will expand the reach of synthetic biology is envisioned - a switch that is activated by cells that recognize "features" on nearby surfaces. Notably, one could build a bacterium that surveys the area-based density of a feature on the surface below. A "go"::"no-go" decision is made and implemented by the "smart" bacterium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One potential application would reengineer bacteria to recognize a cancerous cell from a healthy cell. The cancer cells have more epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on their surfaces than healthy cells. While nanoparticle-based drug delivery brings drugs to any cell displaying the receptor, this new methodology would instead ask the drug carrying bacteria to decide whether the cell is truly cancerous, based on the surface density of the EGFR. The bacteria could then reprogram themselves to synthesize the drug and deliver it. This autonomous smart mode of drug delivery is unprecedented.</AbstractNarration>
