    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Mathematics at Missouri State University will offer summer research opportunities in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in the fields of algebra, combinatorics, analysis, differential equations and numerical analysis. Junior and senior undergraduate students from across the country are invited to apply, but we are especially targeting students from nearby institutions where undergraduate research is limited. This program will involve undergraduate students in active research, help them reach a higher level of independence in mathematical reasoning, and encourage them to pursue graduate studies. The students will learn to assimilate the latest research through reading, discussions and constant interaction with their cohort and experienced faculty mentors. Participants will learn how to effectively communicate their results by writing and presenting them to the mathematical community, and in some cases by publishing in refereed journals. This program is designed in order to achieve the goal of improving participants' understanding of mathematics, leading to the discovery of original results through high-quality research. We are fully committed to substantially increase the participation of women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and first generation students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An NSF-sponsored program such as this is one of the best ways to attract and retain talented undergraduate students, and to help them realize their full potential for research, by involving them in direct interaction with a diverse group of students and experienced faculty mentors. Every effort will be made to foster a sense of community among the REU team of faculty mentors and students, with the goal of providing the undergraduate participants with the experience of being part of a well-integrated research team.</AbstractNarration>
