    <AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funding to support the travel of advanced doctoral students so that they can participate in the 15th International Conference in Artificial Intelligence in Education and in the Young Researchers Track (YRT) that is part of that conference. The Young Researchers Track provides a forum for Ph.D. students to present and discuss their work with mentors from outside of their home institutions and to meet peers with similar interests. Mentoring happens in two ways -- as part of the Young Researchers Track, where they will be encouraged and offered feedback by three mentors, and through an individual mentoring program where each doctoral student will be matched with a mentor with expertise in the student's research area. Mentors will be senior AI and ED researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the Young Researchers Track are members of the next generation of cyberlearning researchers. Participation in the proposed program will supplement their education at their home institutions and help prepare them to be leaders in transforming education through the use of learning technologies.</AbstractNarration>
