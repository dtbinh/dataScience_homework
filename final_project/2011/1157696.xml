    <AbstractNarration>Sensing of biomolecular species with required sensitivity, specificity and engineering constraints is critical to numerous fields; ranging from environmental monitoring of toxic species to personalized health diagnostics. The diverse and multiple considerations for such a viable sensor system require interdisciplinary approach that combines the innate specificity of biological binding events, a signal transduction platform that is widely deployable and the necessary economic, ergonomic and systems-level constraints. &lt;br/&gt;Given such needs for diverse and multifaceted approaches, international collaborations are essential to advancing our understanding of multiplexed integrated sensor arrays for biochemical sensing. Bio-engineered sensors research requires numerous device engineering simulations, process iterations and high-level laboratory experimentation in which Northwestern (NU) and University of Basel (UB) have substantial complementary resources and expertise. &lt;br/&gt;This OISE collaborative project will bring together US and Swiss researchers to address the critical needs in biomolecular sensing. The project leverages strong existing cantilever-based sensors research activities in individual groups at NU in Evanston, IL and UB at Basel, Switzerland. The project aims to develop sensor systems that are simple-to-use, cost effective, widely deployable, and amenable to massively parallel (multiplexed) detection of diverse biomolecular species that are critical to many technologies ? ranging from environmental monitoring to personal health markers. These would include DNAs, proteins and viral pathogens; for example. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed collaboration will provide scientists and students access to facilities and expertise not available at respective individual institutions. The international collaboration will also help industries to engage highly-trained personnel in fields involving applications of multiplexed sensor technologies. The collective effort through this OISE international collaborative program between Northwestern and Basel will set the stage for biomolecular sensor development and applications using silicon-based detection platform that has considerable promise as a point-to-care, handheld, cost-effective and widely deployable detection system.</AbstractNarration>
