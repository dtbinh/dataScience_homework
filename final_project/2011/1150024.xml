    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to recreate the functionality of a natural ion channel using a solid-state nanopore. Natural ion channels are limited to narrow ranges of temperature and pH, limiting their usability for biosensing applications which are now emerging. Replacing natural ion channels with electrostatically controllable solid-state nanopores enables operation of biosensors in a wide range of environmental conditions. The transformative aspect of the project is the ability to create a channel that is reconfigurable via electric fields generated through an arrangement of embedded electrodes in a particular geometry at the nanoscale level. Combined with the use of electroactive polymers which enable the amplification of the nanopore on/off ratio, the proposed platform will be universal and not limited to one particular application.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the ability to perform fundamental studies of ionic and molecular translocation through a nanopore, helping to gain insight into how permeation can be controlled on the nanoscale. Using electrostatic fields inside the nanopore, molecules can be temporarily docked and released, allowing reconfigurable and reusable sensors.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are on molecular filtration, biosensing, and localized drug release and thus potentially improve society at large. The proposed transdisciplinary research will be integrated as an emerging technology into the graduate and undergraduate curriculum. The proposed middle and high school outreach program modules will expose students to critical physical concepts underlying the proposed research, including electric fields, surface tension and low noise electronics.</AbstractNarration>
