    <AbstractNarration>This funding establishes a new CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Montana State University focused on networking and networks with applications for sustainability. Each summer a cohort of undergraduate students will participate in a ten-week summer research program at the host institution. The project includes mentoring by the experienced computer science faculty members, technical seminars and workshops, student presentations, and field trips and other professional development opportunities. The REU Site program will target high-quality undergraduate American Indian students, students from tribal colleges, and students from small colleges with limited resources. Recruitment efforts will focus on computer science and engineering students as well as students from environmental science and other related disciplines. This site is co-funded by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in strong research basis and the expertise of the faculty. The projects are in research areas that are current and address national priorities such as networking and sensor networks. The students participate in a full range of research activities from preparing research literature reviews to production and dissemination of research results. The project has the potential to add to the research base of networking systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to undergraduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups. The project team is committed to including under-represented minority students in their research. Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning.</AbstractNarration>
