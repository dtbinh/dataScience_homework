    <AbstractNarration>With this award, researchers from three U.S. institutions will focus on exploring and understanding near-Earth?s space environment (geospace) through the coordinated use of multiple data sets, including both a variety of individual spacecraft and strategically located ground observatories. Because those parts of the Earth?s magnetic field that reach farthest out into geospace intersect the ground at high latitudes, arrays of ground magnetometers and auroral imagers have long been a valued means of monitoring processes in remote parts of the magnetosphere. The ground stations used in this project are key links in arrays of ground-based ionospheric and magnetospheric observations in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions. In conjunction with data from other instruments located at these sites, with other Antarctic arrays of automated instruments, and with both low-altitude and high-altitude satellites, these instruments have played and will continue to play a significant role in the studies of geospace phenomena including solar wind?magnetosphere interactions and geomagnetic storms and substorms. Taken together, search coil instruments at these stations make it possible to study the entire range of ultra-low frequency (ULF) variations, from Pc 1 and Pi 1 pulsations down to Pc 5 pulsations, magnetic impulse events, sudden impulses, and substorm bays, with high sensitivity. The analysis efforts associated with this project will involve, and are highly suitable for, research training of both undergraduate and graduate students, and build on currently strong programs of faculty and student research.</AbstractNarration>
