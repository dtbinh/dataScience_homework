    <AbstractNarration>Center for Design of Analog-Digital Integrated Circuits (CDADIC) &lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1127853&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Design of Analog-Digital Integrated Circuits (CDADIC) at Washington State University (lead) for work executed at its Oregon State University site. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-601. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of wearable electronics to effectively monitor human activity and physiological signals is emerging as an important area for integrated circuit and system design. Wearable electronics pose distinct challenges to the designer unlike those of traditional electronics environments including light weight, low power, and mixed-signal design often requiring electrical and/or chemical contact with the human subject?s skin and unteathered wireless connection to remote monitoring infrastructure. The proposed research effort will design and demonstrate a wearable sensor for elderly subjects capable of monitoring daily activity patterns and vital signs. The research aims to improve the energy efficiency of specialized analog-digital conversion, wireless transmitters, and digital computing for wearable computing as well as explore data mining approaches for the extraction of diagnostically relevant signatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the aging of the US population, the proposed work has the potential for wide impact in the care of the elderly and their ability to stay longer in their own home environment, thus increasing their positive outcomes and reducing their cost of care. The proposed project has strong support from Analog Devices and Intel, both members of the Center. More broadly, the work has the potential to expand the research portfolio of the center as a whole into the area of wearable electronics, thus impacting the center?s entire industry sector. The PIs have also founded a company to help commercialize work in this area. The proposal lays out concrete plans for involving undergraduates in the work via senior projects.</AbstractNarration>
