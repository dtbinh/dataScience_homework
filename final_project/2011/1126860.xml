    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award provides funding for the acquisition of a Nano-Indenter to improve the nanoscale materials testing and characterization capabilities at the University of Wyoming. The nano-indenter remains one of the few mechanical testing systems that can characterize small-scale materials and components. There are many fundamental research areas of transformative character that a nano-indenter enables to explore. At the University of Wyoming (UW) the specific research activities that will be enabled with the acquisition of the nano-indenter system are quite diverse which also reflects the different backgrounds of the principal investigators in chemical and mechanical engineering. The research activities include (a) size dependent deformation of polymers, (b) synthesis and mechanical characterization of CO2 sorbent materials and (c) encapsulated nanoparticles for drug delivery, as well as (d) collaborative research on small-scale material systems and components which is conducted in a combined experimental and theoretical/simulation based investigation. These research activities represent original research that is or has great potential to be of transformative character. The proposal activities that are enabled with the nano-indenter investigate both fundamental as well as practical aspects that are of direct societal relevance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This nano-indenter complements the research infrastructure and significantly enhances ongoing and future research and will fill a missing gap between mechanical testing/characterization and chemical and optical/dimensional analysis equipment already available at UW. Nanotechnology is one of the core strategic research areas at UW and involves multiple academic disciplines working towards a wide range of applications. Many faculty members will be using the instrument from various academic departments at UW including chemistry, physics and chemical, civil, mechanical engineering. The nano-indenter will further promote and develop collaborations across these disciplines. Besides improving the research infrastructure the nano-indenter will also enhance the training infrastructure for nanotechnology and materials at UW. The associated investigators are involved in projects with (i) engineering undergraduate/graduate students of which many are female students, (ii) dissemination of nanotechnologies for energy production and environmental protection in rural areas of Wyoming, and (iii) mentorships of prospective students with disabilities. In all these activities the equipment has an integrated part in providing hands-on experiences to nanotechnology and will enhance the ability of the involved faculty to promote the interest in engineering and science programs and science in general to the students of Wyoming.</AbstractNarration>
