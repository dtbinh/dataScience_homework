    <AbstractNarration>Second US-Japan Future Network Research Collaboration PI Meeting will be held in Kyoto, Japan in June 2011. Recently, NSF has funded seven collaborative US-Japan research projects on Future Networking. This meeting will bring together US investigators and their graduate students along with the Japanese collaborators at the invitation of the NICT (the funding counterpart of NSF in Japan) to continue to strengthen the collaborations between researchers jointly funded by NSF and the Japanese. This meeting is a continuation of series of NSF-supported workshops with the Japanese. Both countries, through CISE/NSF and Japanese research funding agencies, have major research efforts in networking research and in infrastructure development to support research activities. For NSF the major efforts are NeTSE/NeTS/FIND/FIA, and GENI and other infrastructure development awards. For Japan the initiatives include AKARI, the Japan Gigabit Network (JGN2). Increasingly, our Nation depends on high speed networks for national defense, commerce, and for interactions among out citizens. Research is continually needed to lead to new technology to improve the bandwidth, efficiency, security, and reliability of the networks we do so much rely on. Cooperation with Japan will accelerate the development of advanced networking technologies.</AbstractNarration>
