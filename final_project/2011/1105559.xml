    <AbstractNarration>This work focuses on the detection, manipulation, and use of cold gases of atoms trapped within a high-quality optical resonator. In such a system, the internal state of the atoms -- their quantum spin -- interacts strongly with light injected into the cavity. This well controlled interaction allows us to explore the quantum limits of how well the spin state of the atomic gas can be measured, to direct light-mediated interactions between the atomic spins, and to examine the behavior of a complex quantum system under constant measurement. Specific aims of the effort are to demonstrate a new range of dynamical phenomena predicted to occur due to feedback between the cavity field and the spin ensemble, and to employ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study dynamical phenomena with the highest spatial resolution. Our scientific findings will clarify how complex non-equilibrium phenomena result from the hybridization of several simple quantum elements, and will shed light on magnetic and transport phenomena in solid-state materials. The work also provides excellent laboratory skills and scientific training to future scientific leaders.</AbstractNarration>
