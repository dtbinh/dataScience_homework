    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: Ocean acidification has the potential to affect a broad spectrum of marine organisms and thereby transform the composition and function of our oceans. In contrast to calcifying marine invertebrates, marine fish are widely believed to be unaffected by the CO2 concentrations projected for the future. While this may be so for juvenile and adult fish stages, the fate of fish embryos and larvae in high CO2 oceans is less certain as CO2-sensitivity data for these stages are largely unavailable. Recognizing this knowledge gap and inspired by the findings of two recent studies on clownfish and sea bass larvae (Munday et al. PNAS 107 (2010); Checkley et al. Science 324 (2009)), the investigators performed a series of experiments exposing eggs and early larvae of inland silversides (Menidia beryllina) to elevated CO2 levels while strictly adhering to current "best practice" guidelines for ocean acidification research. At 1,000 ppm CO2, average M. beryllina survival ~1wk post-hatch significantly and consistently (five experiments) declined by ~75% compared to current day CO2 levels (390 ppm), while average length of newly hatched larvae decreased by 22%. Together with prior studies, these results suggest a surprisingly high susceptibility of fish early life stages to the CO2 increases that are projected to occur this century. Given that the abundance of many fish stocks, including most commercial species, is often regulated by processes affecting early life history growth and survival, ocean acidification may impact the dynamics of future fish populations and become yet another challenge to sustainable fisheries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators believe that there is now a pressing need to better understand how CO2 affects the viability of fish embryos and larvae in the ocean. This requires novel approaches involving longer-term, larger-scale experiments across multiple species. The investigators will comprehensively examine the impacts of current and future CO2 levels (400 - 1,000 ppm) during the egg and larval stages of three model fish species: Atlantic silversides (M. menidia), inland silversides (M. beryllina) and sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus). They will also investigate populations of the same species (M. menidia) from differing latitudes. These species/populations are ecologically important due to their intermediate trophic position, have comparable life histories to commercial marine fish, offer differences in genetic growth capacity and presumed sensitivity, and are highly amenable to laboratory experimentation. Survival and growth (weight- and length-based) will be measured in experiments performed at different CO2, temperature (21, 27Â°C) and feeding conditions (low, ad libitum), thus permitting the affects of CO2 to be considered in parallel with thermal stress and food limitation. Quantification of feeding rates, gross growth efficiency, and oxygen consumption will characterize the physiological costs of high CO2 environments. Changes in calcification of larval fish otoliths and skeletal elements will be determined from weights and a Ca45 radiotracer approach. Finally, surviving M. menidia (or M. beryllina) will be reared to maturity and their offspring will be challenged with differing levels of CO2. Repeating this approach over several generations will demonstrate the extent to which CO2 resistance may evolve through natural selection. Collectively, this study will make significant advances toward understanding how ocean acidification may challenge the world's most valuable marine resource, fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This investigation will serve as the dissertation topic for a doctoral student at Stony Brook University and will support a female post-doctoral researcher. The PIs have a strong record of supporting diversity in education and in enriching undergraduate and secondary school education and research and will continue these practices for this project. A novel outreach program has the potential to reach one million aquarium patrons during the project.</AbstractNarration>
