    <AbstractNarration>Today, practically all processors employ instruction set architectures which are functionally&lt;br/&gt;equivalent to each other. Compiler/micro-architecture cooperation using these traditional&lt;br/&gt;representations has already reached the point of diminishing returns. This project therefore&lt;br/&gt;investigates the domain of single assignment program representations and direct support of this&lt;br/&gt;domain through micro-architecture implementation as a key concept that can break the barriers&lt;br/&gt;between the compilers and architectures. If successful, this new approach can have a significant&lt;br/&gt;impact on the design of future processors, design of compiler internal representations as well as&lt;br/&gt;the back-end of the compilers. It can also affect how parallelism is exploited at various&lt;br/&gt;granularities and how various optimizations are carried out. The investigated framework can help&lt;br/&gt;revitalize computer architecture and compiler optimization research by opening up unexplored paths&lt;br/&gt;for research in high-performance systems. Consequently, it can affect every field of science and&lt;br/&gt;commerce which rely on high-performance computation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compiler/hardware integration around the concept of single-assignment form has many benefits&lt;br/&gt;spanning three fields. First, in the area of process synchronization it provides the opportunity to&lt;br/&gt;eliminate the need for explicit synchronization. Second, in the field of micro-architecture renaming&lt;br/&gt;of instruction streams becomes substantially simpler, micro-architectures can become loop-aware,&lt;br/&gt;renamed instruction streams can be re-renamed and compiler techniques such as partial redundancy&lt;br/&gt;elimination or constant propagation can dynamically be performed by the micro-architecture.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the compilers can focus on what they do best by sharing a common representation with the&lt;br/&gt;micro-architecture. As a result, many key optimizations can be efficiently performed. Within&lt;br/&gt;this paradigm, it becomes possible to develop new optimization algorithms which will rely on the&lt;br/&gt;micro-architecture to perform the optimization using analysis performed by the compilers.</AbstractNarration>
