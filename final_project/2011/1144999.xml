    <AbstractNarration>This award is made to the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) to hold a workshop in the area of sensor technologies together with the Irish counterpart of the National Science Foundation. The focus is not as much on sensor networks, but more on how lower level circuits and device technology including emerging bio-nano sensor technologies can have a possible impact. Various application areas e.g., from civil infrastructure to bio-sensing will be examined, with primary focus on circuits and device technologies. Various relevant industry constituents, both from the US and Europe, are going to be invited to this workshop, but for obvious reasons only the US participants will be able to receive benefits of NSF support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential broader impact of the outcome of the workshop, albeit of somewhat technical nature, is expectedly very large. One of the several goals is to explore new technologies that may lead to small businesses and startups. In this vein, the several US academic participants with experience with startup technologies are being invited as well. In the long run sensors may benefit the educational arena as well via adoption of sensor technology in new courses and university curriculum, but the present proposal does not plan to be engaged in such activities.</AbstractNarration>
