    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project from Symbios Technologies LLC advances a&lt;br/&gt;novel plasma reactor method to oxidize organic matter in untreated water. This method has further potential to&lt;br/&gt;destroy harmful substances such as pesticides, pathogens, and some inorganics. A provisional patent covering this&lt;br/&gt;technology has been filed with the U.S. Patent office. In earlier research, a proof-of-concept batch apparatus&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated that this reactor could destroy selected organic compounds and pathogens. However, this early&lt;br/&gt;version could not be economically scaled up nor run in a continuous mode. This Phase I project will build a new&lt;br/&gt;apparatus design at a laboratory scale, capable of treating water continuously. Studies will then be conducted to&lt;br/&gt;verify the effectiveness of the new reactor design, and to investigate the mechanisms and kinetics of the&lt;br/&gt;degradation of a selected organic compound.&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are: an economical and effective method to treat raw&lt;br/&gt;water, input water, industrial wastewater, and contaminated potable water; and potential portability to desired&lt;br/&gt;locations. There are several ongoing incidences of waterborne diseases in many parts of the world and economical&lt;br/&gt;options for on-site treatment are limited. Our analytical projections indicate that it would be feasible to treat large&lt;br/&gt;quantities of untreated water economically on a commercial scale using a portable system. Furthermore, this&lt;br/&gt;apparatus would be compatible with renewable energy sources and with extended applications to remote sites, such&lt;br/&gt;as military bases and disaster relief operations.</AbstractNarration>
