    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit. Microbial synthesis of fatty-acid-derived hydrocarbon molecules (alkanes and alkenes) has garnered intense interest in recent years as potential sources of renewable fuels and chemicals. Realization of this potential necessitates a molecular-level understanding of the genes and gene functions involved in microbial hydrocarbon biosynthesis and their relationship with the fatty acid biosynthetic processes that provide the chemical backbone for these hydrocarbon products. The current project focuses on several newly discovered microbial biosynthetic pathways catalyzing the formation of secondary lipids, accessory lipid molecules that are chemically distinct from core (primary) fatty acid products and synthesized via a novel biosynthetic mechanism in diverse microbial lineages. Our current knowledge of chemical products associated with secondary lipid biosynthetic pathways is severely limited. Likewise, the biological function(s) of these lipid classes is unknown. The goal of this CAREER project is to characterize the genetic and physiological basis of unique microbial fatty acid and fatty acid-derived hydrocarbon biosynthesis. A key deliverable of this research will be a translational framework uniting functionally diverse microbial processes involved in lipid and hydrocarbon synthesis with the physiological, ecological and evolutionary underpinnings of lipid diversification. To confront these outstanding scientific questions and advance the scientific foundation for the production of renewable commodity hydrocarbons, the research strategy involves three synergistic specific aims: Pathway Discovery, Product Discovery, and Physiological Significance. By integrating comprehensive data-mining strategies that leverage all available genomic and metagenomic sequence archives and the direct interrogation of environmental samples for lipid and hydrocarbon biosynthetic activities, the proposed research will deliver important new insight into microbial lipid metabolism as it relates to bioenergy applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. In addition to its scientific and societal impacts relevant to bioenergy, this project will directly contribute to the teaching and training of students in diverse scientific disciplines including bioinformatics, genetics, analytical chemistry, and biotechnology. To enhance the infrastructure for research and education, one key deliverable of this research will be a comprehensive database devoted to microbial lipid and hydrocarbon biosynthesis. This research component will provide actionable data for potential biotechnological application and exploitation. Furthermore, to extend the impact of this research and engage a broader student audience, a globally accessible educational resource will be developed highlighting the exciting concept of biological discovery to biotechnological application. The interactive learning and analysis portal will serve as a general biology, genomics and computational biology educational platform and will be integrated as part of the Community cyberinfrastructure for Advanced Microbial Ecology Research and Analysis (CAMERA) resource.</AbstractNarration>
