    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Kirk S. Schanze of the University of Florida will investigate fundamental properties of carrier transport in conducting polymer molecular wires and thin films. The overall objective of the program is to provide a clear understanding of the structure, energetics and dynamics of triplet exciton states in pi-conjugated, weakly conjugated and non-conjugated model molecular and polymeric chromophore assembliles. The structures that will be the focus of study feature platinum metal units as a primary element. These metal centers serve to enhance triplet spin state generation in the materials and promote room temperature phosphorescence. Understanding the properties of photoexcited states in molecules and polymers with delocalized electronic systems is very important because these materials are receiving a great deal of attention from scientists and engineers for application in a new generation of plastic electronic devices. In particular, the questions addressed in this research program are broadly relevant to applications of organic and organometallic materials in high efficiency light sources (organic light emitting diodes), organic solar cells (light driven electrical power generation), and in control and attenuation of laser light (non-linear optical materials). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program provides also serves as key training for postdoc, graduate and undergraduate students in the principal investigator's laboratory. These students obtain broad training in skills ranging from synthetic chemistry to the application of physical methods such as optical spectroscopy and materials characterization. In addition, as part of this project the research group will participate in the Student Science Training Program (SSTP) with a seven-week residential program held each summer at the University of Florida for high school students (11th and 12th graders) interested in careers in science, math and engineering. Each summer the Schanze group will host an SSTP student, getting them involved in the research project, as well as interacting with the full group of SSTP students in seminar and workshop settings.</AbstractNarration>
