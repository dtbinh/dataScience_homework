    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial financial support for travel and meeting registration expenses of six early career U.S. geochemists and petrologists to participate in the 74th Mineralogical Society of America (MSA)- and Geochemical Society (GS)-sponsored Short Course on 'Sulfur in Magmas and Melts and Its Importance for Natural and Technical Processes' and its associated two-day summer school activities to be held in Germany. Funding will facilitate the participation by early career U.S. investigators (graduate students and postdoctoral researchers) in geochemistry and petrology who might not otherwise attend given the expense of air travel to Europe in the summer months. This short course brings together experts in diverse fields to discuss recent research findings as well as strategies for future collaborative research on topics related to the role of the volatile component sulfur in a wide variety of natural processes bearing on magmas, mineralization, and volcanism and on processes of manufacturing glasses and steels for industrial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the 74th MSA/GS Short Course will foster research collaboration and sharing of information between investigators of natural processes involving magmatic sulfur, processes of producing synthetic glasses that involve sulfur, and those involved in steel production and the importance and behavior of sulfur. Students and postdocs will be required to submit an abstract and share their scientific results in a poster session, and they will also have numerous opportunities to interact with senior researchers in the crossover fields of petrology, geochemistry (melts, minerals, and fluids), mineral deposits, stable isotope systematics, experimental petrology, glass production, and steel production. The participants will also have the unique opportunity to receive training in two, one-day summer school, laboratory-based activities to be held at universities in Germany (which have been designed by a co-organizer of the short course). These activities are focused on experimental and analytical techniques involving sulfur in aluminosilicate melts and glasses. This summer school will serve to broaden the impact of the short course for early career scientists.</AbstractNarration>
