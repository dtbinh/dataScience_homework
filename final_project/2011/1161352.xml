    <AbstractNarration>In problem-based learning models, such as scenario-based learning (SBL), learning activities are situated in contexts that resemble those students would encounter in the workplace. Yet integrating scenario-based learning into the community college environment requires change and an understanding of the ways that this pedagogical approach can be adapted to meet the needs of the faculty practitioner. Action research is used to engage faculty, under the guidance of professional researchers, in examining the challenges of implementing SBL instruction in technician education. An online community of practice is developed by establishing a library of SBL resources and by linking to ATE centers and projects, initially in biology and bio-informatics. Three prototype online wizards are developed and tested to support community college instructors in editing existing SBL activities, in creating new SBL activities and in creating principled assessments items using the ideas of evidence-centered design. An advisory board of industry representatives and educational researchers in the fields of teaming, problem based learning and collaborative learning guide the development and validation of the scenarios. The evaluation determines metrics to measure the extent to which the SBLs prove useful to faculty and students in technical education.</AbstractNarration>
