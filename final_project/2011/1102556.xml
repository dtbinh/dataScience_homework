    <AbstractNarration>The IEEE INFOCOM Conference on Computer Communications will be held in Shanghai, China from April 10 to April 15, 2011. This flagship technical conference is a premier venue for presenting new research results in the area of computer communications, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field. Attending conferences such as INFOCOM is of great importance for the development of graduate students. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of others performing leading-edge research in the field. This proposal requests funds to support approximately fourteen graduate students in the United States to attend this premier conference. Women and under-represented minorities will be encouraged to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the proposal resides in encouraging and supporting graduate student attendance to INFOCOM 2011. This will continue the tradition of the previous INFOCOM conferences as a premier venue for bringing together academia, industry, and government to share newest developments in communications. Besides technical paper presentations, the conference offers a wide range of technical activities including workshops and work-in-progress sessions. Its rich program exposes participants to new ideas and cutting-edge research and allows for interaction between researchers from all over the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project integrates research and education of graduate students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have the opportunity to attend high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers as well as peers in the field. The proposed student participation is expected to have a positive impact on the students' research interests and quality. The project will also promote diversity by encouraging and enabling women and other under-represented minorities to participate. Furthermore, the truly international flavor of INFOCOM is well-known and reflected in the composition of the Technical Program Committee (TPC) as well as in the authors of the submitted and accepted papers. As such, it cultivates international research interactions and presents a real opportunity to students to increase their breadth of ideas, research approaches, and technical perspectives.</AbstractNarration>
