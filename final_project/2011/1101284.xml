    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: EPS-1101284&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Iowa EPSCoR: Harnessing Energy Flows in the Biosphere to Build Sustainable Energy Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Iowa State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Infrastructure Improvement project seeks to expand the research capacity within the state to support a transition in energy supply from subsurface fossil energy stores to renewable energy flows at or near the earth?s surface. The research program is organized into four platforms in renewable energy, each of which consists of several research foci (or planks) which are detailed below. The project seeks to examine energy flows and processes from a holistic systems perspective that considers technical, economic, social, and environmental constraints and impacts. This comprehensive program will enable innovative research, strengthen energy-related education, train a ?clean-tech? workforce, and engage diverse communities in implementing environmentally and economically sustainable solutions to the growing energy challenges facing Iowa and the U.S. The project brings together research universities, 2- and 4-year colleges, the private sector, and local government agencies (Iowa Power Fund, Iowa Office of Energy Independence), to address key issues related to renewable energy research, education, and workforce development in the state. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to significantly enhance the research competitiveness of Iowa through a comprehensive, multi-faceted research program in renewable energy and energy efficiency. The program builds upon existing strengths of Iowa in the areas of bioenergy and wind energy while including highly complementary components in the areas of energy efficiency and energy policy. The program seeks to change the energy landscape across Iowa by improving the energy balance while mitigating environmental concerns and positioning citizens to compete more effectively in a global economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;An overarching goal of this project is to translate the knowledge gained in the research platforms into specific actions that can increase the participation of under-represented minorities in STEM fields. IA EPSCoR proposes the creation of the Future Leaders in Advancing Renewable Energy (FLARE) Institute to lead the implementation of strategic broader impacts activities. Modeled after the Iowa?s NSF I3 program, Strengthening the Professoriate at ISU, the FLARE Institute will be a state-wide organization supporting the human infrastructure development needed to accelerate Iowa?s transition to a green economy. Critical to this goal are strategies to broaden the participation of women, underrepresented minorities, and first-generation college students in the STEM fields, prepare a workforce that can meet the demands of Iowa?s emerging green economy, and create a community of scholars who integrate broader impacts into their research efforts in all fields. Accordingly, the FLARE Institute will address key deficiencies in state-wide infrastructure by integrating broader impacts through all elements of activities leveraged by IA EPSCoR, thereby having a far greater state-wide impact than any individual program could achieve on its own.</AbstractNarration>
