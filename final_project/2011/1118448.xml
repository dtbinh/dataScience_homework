    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The MEMS community comes together annually at a few high-quality conferences. IEEE MEMS is one of these conferences. Now in its 24th year, it has the reputation to attract the best new results research and the top scientists in the field. For a recent or soon-to-be Ph.D. graduate, it is one of the best opportunities to disseminate one?s work, to network, and to position oneself in the job market. Presenting a paper or poster at IEEE MEMS is a valuable experience; giving a talk to the 700+ attendees in a large lecture hall is a unique event in one?s career. This grant will help maximizing the number of students that can have this experience.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The IEEE MEMS 11 program consists of single-track oral presentations and poster sessions. In addition, group lunches and dinners will provide ample opportunities for attendees to network and socialize. In addition, we are introducing several innovations to the format and organization of IEEE MEMS that are intended to strengthen its impact.&lt;br/&gt;The support for this conference will enable and enhance graduate student participation.</AbstractNarration>
