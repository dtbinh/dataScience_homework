    <AbstractNarration>This is workshop travel support for 14 junior scientists (mostly graduate students, with a few postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;researchers) from the USA to travel to Sanya, Hainan China for the Symposium in geophysical&lt;br/&gt;imaging. The NSF of China has some co-funding to support the local accommodations for the&lt;br/&gt;invited speakers, and for the registrations and other conference expenses. IASPEI (International&lt;br/&gt;Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth?s Interior), SEG (Society of Exploration&lt;br/&gt;Geophysicists) and EAGE (European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers) have endorsed&lt;br/&gt;and listed the Symposium as their formal symposium or workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geophysical imaging is the key for subsurface structural delineation, target detection and&lt;br/&gt;property inversion. It has a wide range of applications to subsurface resources exploration, crust&lt;br/&gt;and mantle structures, earthquake rapture process and fault structure, and shallow target&lt;br/&gt;detection. Due to the increasingly high complexity of the geological environments for oil/gas&lt;br/&gt;exploration and other imaging targets, such as for monitoring CO2 sequestration and pollution&lt;br/&gt;control, and the explosively increased data amount collected by the new acquisition system, highresolution,&lt;br/&gt;high-fidelity and high-efficiency imaging methods are highly in demanding. For highresolution,&lt;br/&gt;high-fidelity imaging, we need much more phase-space information, such as the main&lt;br/&gt;direction of the local energy flux, instant frequency of the wavefield, rather than a straightforward&lt;br/&gt;space-domain solution. In other words, we need accurate and efficient propagators with phasespace&lt;br/&gt;localizations. Such phase-space information is crucial in modern true-amplitude, truereflection&lt;br/&gt;imaging and parameter inversion. With phase-space localized wave propagators, local&lt;br/&gt;AVA (amplitude variation with angle), local inversion for reservoir parameters can be performed&lt;br/&gt;and the close link between imaging and inversion can be established. Recently emerged seismic&lt;br/&gt;imaging methods using fast beam, fast wavepacket and other localized waves, such as beamlet,&lt;br/&gt;curvelet, have brought up broad interests in the study of imaging using localized waves. The&lt;br/&gt;relevant researches have been spread to many branches of physics, acoustics, seismology,&lt;br/&gt;engineering and mathematics.The symposium is different from other&lt;br/&gt;geophysical conferences and workshops in its broad scope and interdisciplinary interactions. The&lt;br/&gt;intensive invited speeches serves as introductory lectures by the experts of different fields.</AbstractNarration>
