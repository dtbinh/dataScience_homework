    <AbstractNarration>This engineering education research initiation grant will partner engineering education researchers and material science faculty to look at how programming skills taught in a material science context help students learn material science concepts. The proposed research will investigate the impact the intervention has on both students and faculty at the participating institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to engage material science faculty in developing research-based content in material science as well as develop content modules that can be broadly disseminated. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by making investments that lead to emerging new fields of engineering, or shifting existing fields. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.</AbstractNarration>
