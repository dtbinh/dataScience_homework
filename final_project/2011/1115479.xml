    <AbstractNarration>This is a request to support US students and post-doctoral researcher participation in the 9th International Symposium on Geochemistry of the Earth?s Surface (GES-9) and in an International Critical Zone Student Symposium. GES-9 with about 150 international participants is a triennial meeting sponsored by the International Association of GeoChemistry (IAGC) and will be held at the University of Colorado, Boulder, June 3-7, 2011. The International Critical Zone Student Symposium will take place June 1-2, 2011. The goal is to train students to find the connections across spatial scales and disciplinary boundaries through in-depth presentations by leading scientists, exposure to new field sites, and discussions with colleagues around the world. All of these will happen for students in the focused week of activities associated with GES-9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will directly support 15 young researchers and help them establish community with other critical zone researchers. A similar number of students from the SoilTrEC (Soil Transformations in European Catchments) project in Europe will participate in the event.</AbstractNarration>
