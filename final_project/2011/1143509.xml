    <AbstractNarration>This project provides funding for international travel support to approximately 4 early-career professionals and 8 students to attend the international conference "Fragile Earth: Geological Processes from Global to Local Scales, Associated Hazards &amp; Resources" that will be held in Munich, Germany, from September, 4-7, 2011. Major topics addressed at this conference are: (1) subduction zone processes at global, regional, and local scales; (2) intraplate earthquakes, natural hazards and risks; (3) geological resources and sedimentary geodynamic processes; and (4) geoeducation in highschools, universities and public outreach through geoparks and geoheritage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international conference addresses many current and central research topics in tectonics and related fields, including sessions devoted to the recent Tohoku earthquake. The conference affords international participants the opportunity to share recent research results and initiate new international research partnerships. Conveners will make efforts to broaden participation through support students and early career researchers from underrepresented groups in the earth sciences.</AbstractNarration>
