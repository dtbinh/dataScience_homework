    <AbstractNarration>Bolivia adopted a new constitution in 2009; the new constitution provides an opportunity to analyze &lt;br/&gt;how people understand a constitution, and how a national constitution intersects with international &lt;br/&gt;legal frameworks. The workshop is guided by the questions of whether or not and how Bolivians, &lt;br/&gt;as they go through constitutional change will propose alternatives to globally prevalent intellectual &lt;br/&gt;and cultural property frameworks. These global regimes too often discussed only at international and &lt;br/&gt;national levels--have fallen short as regards recognition of collective creativity, access in unequal &lt;br/&gt;social terrains, and resolution of state-indigenous contradictions about heritage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working from the ground up, the workshop will initiate a dialogue&lt;br/&gt;about indigenous rights and cultural property that does not dismiss economic motivations,&lt;br/&gt;considers a multiplicity of proprietary systems, addresses already identified social values of&lt;br/&gt;creativity and acknowledgement, and locates cultural property claims in relation to other local&lt;br/&gt;indigenous struggles. As the poorest and most indigenous country of South America, Bolivia poses &lt;br/&gt;pressing local and globally germane challenges for intellectual property, which in Bolivia is viewed by some as an&lt;br/&gt;external legal mechanism designed to deny majority access to knowledge, and by others as a&lt;br/&gt;route out of the nation&amp;#700;s economic woes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will facilitate discussion among Bolivians through (a) an intensive four-day participatory&lt;br/&gt;workshop on cultural and intellectual property involving twenty participants who do creative&lt;br/&gt;performance work, represent indigenous organizations, or work in local media, and (b) a mediabased&lt;br/&gt;dissemination program. Principal investigators from the U.S. and the U.K. and two&lt;br/&gt;Bolivian research assistants will draw on collaborative ethnographic methods to coordinate the&lt;br/&gt;workshop and media-based dialogues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop proceedings will be summarized for international circulation through a Spanish-English&lt;br/&gt;bilingual website. Before and after the workshop, television and radio discussions (sometimes in&lt;br/&gt;indigenous languages) will further disseminate these conversations among Bolivia&amp;#700;s poorer urban&lt;br/&gt;and rural populations where Internet access is limited. Through the workshop&amp;#700;s activities, local&lt;br/&gt;voices rarely heard in the international context will be brought into broader global debates, and&lt;br/&gt;Bolivians will be provided with greater access to diverse perspectives on cultural property.&lt;br/&gt;Through the website and subsequent reports, connections will be sought with other international&lt;br/&gt;and national entities engaged in these issues.</AbstractNarration>
