    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Zhiping Zheng of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at University of Arizona will systematically explore the synthesis of structurally interesting and practically significant lanthanide cluster complexes. Studies will be carried out using amino acids and amino acid-like ligands, functionalized carboxylates, and beta-diketonates to control the hydrolysis of the lanthanide ions and the assembly of high-nuclearity clusters. The templating effects of anions in the assembly of such species will be investigated. Functionalized beta-diketonates will be used for the making of cluster complexes that are potentially useful in biomedical imaging, luminescent liquid-crystal displays, magneto-optical data storage, and magnetic refrigeration technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will lead to much needed synthetic approaches to fundamentally interesting but otherwise synthetically elusive lanthanide compounds. Discovery of lanthanide-containing materials with significant technological applications is anticipated. The research will provide ample opportunities for the education and training of students, from pre-undergraduate to graduate, including those from groups that are historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>
