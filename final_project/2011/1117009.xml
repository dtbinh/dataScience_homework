    <AbstractNarration>The rich information generated by computer and human networks creates exciting opportunities for network analytics, namely, the process of gaining knowledge and insights by mining a large amount of network data collected by a diverse set of monitors. To enable effective network analytics, several significant challenges must be addressed:&lt;br/&gt;--- (i) Scalability. The enormous scale of computer and human networks makes it challenging to analyze massive network datasets in a scalable fashion. &lt;br/&gt;--- (ii) Complexity. Real-world network datasets are complex and often violate the operational conditions of existing analysis techniques. &lt;br/&gt;--- (iii) Robustness. Anomalies and imperfections are common in real-world network datasets. &lt;br/&gt;--- (iv) Diversity. Network analytics often requires mining information from diverse data sources with different characteristics and data quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses the above challenges by developing a series of novel compressive sensing techniques to effectively exploit the presence of structure and redundancy in real-world network datasets, including:&lt;br/&gt;--- (i) clustered spectral graph embedding, a novel technique for reducing a massive graph to a much smaller graph while preserving essential clustering and spectral information of the original graph,&lt;br/&gt;--- (ii) LENS decomposition, a novel method for accurately decomposing a network data matrix into a Low-rank matrix, an Error term, a Noise matrix, and a Sparse matrix, and &lt;br/&gt;--- (iii) multi-source spectral learning, a novel framework for effectively integrating information from diverse data sources. The research promises to significantly enhance the ability to analyze massive network datasets. &lt;br/&gt;The resulting tools and techniques have potential applications in business, information technology, networking and cyber security. Finally, the research includes a significant education and training component. The research results will be integrated into both undergraduate and graduate curricula as well as outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
