    <AbstractNarration>NSF funding will be used to support the participation of US scientists to a workshop on spintronic materials, "Workshop on Spin Transport in Solids", that will be held in Beijing, China. The main objective of the workshop is to provide an interactive forum for leading researchers to present and discuss their most recent findings, to afford a platform for graduate and post-doctoral students, primarily from China, to describe their progress in verbal and poster format, and to allow scientists, both young and mature, to have informal and in depth discussion with one another. The scientific scope ranges from novel materials, including concentrated and diluted magnetic semiconductors, to semiconductor device structures, to techniques to probe spin dynamics and to the description, both experimental and theoretical, of spin motion in non-magnetic materials. The broader impacts of the workshop range from providing an international experience to junior researchers to stimulate networking of US scientists with Chinese investigators.</AbstractNarration>
