    <AbstractNarration>This project is focusing on retaining students who express an interest in STEM and attracting students already on campus with a demonstrated proficiency in STEM-related fields. Notre Dame's top-ranked business school attracts many undergraduates who have the aptitude to succeed in STEM majors. This project is engaging their interest in engineering and science while ensuring they have the mathematics background to be successful in STEM. The Colleges of Business, Science and Engineering are creating new business minors for STEM students, to provide them with the business background that they desire. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project is developing a STEM Learning Community Network on campus by implementing the following programs and activities: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) introducing Electronic Portfolios (ePortfolios) as a tool for student planning, reflection, and advising;&lt;br/&gt;(2) eliminating curricular roadblocks in the introductory mathematics courses by developing new Bridging Mathematics Course Modules;&lt;br/&gt;(3) establishing academic year and summer Academic Success Programs that enhance study skills;&lt;br/&gt;(4) expanding opportunities for Authentic Professional Experience and Engaged Scholarship for first-year students through undergraduate research and community-based programs; and&lt;br/&gt;(5) promoting a STEM-supportive campus culture through a STEM Student Ambassador Program in the residence halls and other student-led initiatives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These activities are increasing the number of STEM graduates and improving STEM education at Notre Dame. STEM Student Ambassadors are improving the awareness and appreciation of STEM among all students on campus, while ePortfolios and the Academic Success Programs are enhancing student engagement and proficiency for all majors. Community-based engaged scholarship programs are building partnerships with area K-12 schools, further promoting STEM learning in the region.</AbstractNarration>
