    <AbstractNarration>This project is jointly funded by the Energy, Power, and Adaptive Systems (EPAS) Program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) and the Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM) Program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Objectives and Approaches: &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to use chemical vapor-based atomic and molecular layer deposition methods for the development of highly efficient cost effective organic solar cells with a particular focus on dye solar cells. The approach is multidisciplinary and uses a combined experimental-modeling approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The research addresses the fundamental issues associated with the deposition and characterization of ultra-thin metal oxides and organic dyes on the surface of nanoporous inorganic photoelectrodes along with the characterization and analysis of charge transport at the gas phase synthesized organic-inorganic heterointerfaces. The major research tasks include: 1. Engineering electronic properties of nanostructured heterointerfaces using ultra-thin atomic layer deposited metal oxides, 2. Developing an organic dye loading process using a pulsed molecular layer deposition method, 3. Developing a high throughput DSC process, and 4. Understanding the charge transport and origin of efficiency enhancement in interface engineered DSCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is expected to lead to new methodologies for enhancing electronic quality of photovoltaic heterointerfaces and loading organic light absorbers onto nanostructured inorganic photoelectrodes and open new paradigms in processing and cost-effectiveness of dye solar cells. Topics related to the proposed research will be integrated into the PI's "Fundamentals of Photovoltaics" and "Advanced photovoltaics" courses. This research will involve female students and students from underrepresented groups in the proposed research tasks. A one day long summer camp will be initiated to raise the awareness of Brookings high school students to the science and technology of green energy.</AbstractNarration>
